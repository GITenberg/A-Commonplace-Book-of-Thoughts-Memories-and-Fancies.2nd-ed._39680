<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">must</span> be allowed to say a few words in explanation
of the contents of this little volume, which is truly
what its name sets forth&mdash;a book of common-places, and
nothing more. If I have never, in any work I have
ventured to place before the public, aspired to <i>teach</i>,
(being myself a <i>learner</i> in all things,) at least I have
hitherto done my best to deserve the indulgence I have
met with; and it would pain me if it could be supposed
that such indulgence had rendered me presumptuous or
careless.</p>

<p>For many years I have been accustomed to make a
memorandum of any thought which might come across
me&mdash;(if pen and paper were at hand), and to mark (and
<i>remark</i>) any passage in a book which excited either a
sympathetic or an antagonistic feeling. This collection
of notes accumulated insensibly from day to day. The
volumes on Shakspeare&#8217;s Women, on Sacred and Legendary
Art, and various other productions, sprung from seed thus
lightly and casually sown, which, I hardly know how,
grew up and expanded into a regular, readable form, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
a beginning, a middle, and an end. But what was to be
done with the fragments which remained&mdash;without beginning,
and without end&mdash;links of a hidden or a broken
chain? Whether to preserve them or destroy them became
a question, and one I could not answer for myself.
In allowing a portion of them to go forth to the world in
their original form, as unconnected fragments, I have
been guided by the wishes of others, who deemed it not
wholly uninteresting or profitless to trace the path, sometimes
devious enough, of an &#8220;inquiring spirit,&#8221; even by
the little pebbles dropped as vestiges by the way side.</p>

<p>A book so supremely egotistical and subjective can do
good only in one way. It may, like conversation with
a friend, open up sources of sympathy and reflection; excite
to argument, agreement, or disagreement; and, like
every spontaneous utterance of thought out of an earnest
mind, suggest far higher and better thoughts than any to
be found here to higher and more productive minds. If
I had not the humble hope of such a possible result,
instead of sending these memoranda to the printer, I
should have thrown them into the fire; for I lack that
creative faculty which can work up the teachings of
heart-sorrow and world-experience into attractive forms
of fiction or of art; and having no intention of leaving
any such memorials to be published after my death, they
must have gone into the fire as the only alternative left.</p>

<p>The passages from books are not, strictly speaking,
<i>selected</i>; they are not given here on any principle of
choice, but simply because that by some process of assimilation
they became a part of the individual mind. They
&#8220;found <i>me</i>,&#8221;&mdash;to borrow Coleridge&#8217;s expression,&mdash;&#8220;found
me in some depth of my being;&#8221; I did not &#8220;find <i>them</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span></p>

<p>For the rest, all those passages which are marked by
inverted commas must be regarded as borrowed, though I
have not always been able to give my authority. All
passages not so marked are, I dare not say, original or
new, but at least the unstudied expression of a free discursive
mind. Fruits, not advisedly plucked, but which
the variable winds have shaken from the tree: some ripe,
some &#8220;harsh and crude.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wordsworth&#8217;s famous poem of &#8220;The Happy Warrior&#8221;
(of which a new application will be found at page 87.),
is supposed by Mr. De Quincey to have been first
suggested by the character of Nelson. It has since been
applied to Sir Charles Napier (the Indian General), as
well as to the Duke of Wellington; all which serves
to illustrate my position, that the lines in question are
equally applicable to any man or any woman whose moral
standard is irrespective of selfishness and expediency.</p>

<p>With regard to the fragment on Sculpture, it may be
necessary to state that it was written in 1848. The first
three paragraphs were inserted in the Art Journal for
April, 1849. It was intended to enlarge the whole into
a comprehensive essay on &#8220;Subjects fitted for Artistic
Treatment;&#8221; but this being now impossible, the fragment
is given as originally written; others may think
it out, and apply it better than I shall live to do.</p>

great vanity in withdrawing and retiring men&#8217;s
conceits from the world, as in obtruding them.&#8221;
Extreme vanity sometimes hides under the garb of
ultra modesty. When I see people haunted by the
idea of self,&mdash;spreading their hands before their
faces lest they meet the reflection of it in every
other face, as if the world were to them like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
French drawing-room, panelled with looking glass,&mdash;always
fussily putting their obtrusive self behind
them, or dragging over it a scanty drapery of consciousness,
miscalled modesty,&mdash;always on their
defence against compliments, or mistaking sympathy
for compliment, which is as great an error, and a
more vulgar one than mistaking flattery for sympathy,&mdash;when
I see all this, as I have seen it, I am
inclined to attribute it to the immaturity of the
character, or to what is worse, a total want of simplicity.
To some characters fame is like an intoxicating
cup placed to the lips,&mdash;they do well to turn
away from it, who fear it will turn their heads. But
to others, fame is &#8220;love disguised,&#8221; the love that
answers to love, in its widest most exalted sense. It
seems to me, that we should all bring the best that
is in us (according to the diversity of gifts which
God has given us), and lay it a reverend offering on
the altar of humanity,&mdash;if not to burn and enlighten,
at least to rise in incense to heaven. So will the
pure in heart, and the unselfish do; and they will
not heed if those who <i>can</i> bring nothing or <i>will</i>
bring nothing, unless they can blaze like a beacon,
call out &#8220;<span class="smcap">VANITY!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span>
It is well that we obtain what we require at the
cheapest possible rate; yet those who cheapen
goods, or beat down the price of a good article, or buy
in preference to what is good and genuine of its kind
an inferior article at an inferior price, sometimes do
much mischief. Not only do they discourage the
production of a better article, but if they be anxious
about the education of the lower classes they undo
with one hand what they do with the other; they
encourage the mere mechanic and the production of
what may be produced without effort of mind and
without education, and they discourage and wrong
the skilled workman for whom education has done
much more and whose education has cost much more.</p>

<p>Every work so merely and basely mechanical,
that a man can throw into it no part of his own life
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
and soul, does, in the long run, degrade the human
being. It is only by giving him some kind of mental
and moral interest in the labour of his hands, making
it an exercise of his understanding, and an object of
his sympathy, that we can really elevate the workman;
and this is not the case with very cheap production
of any kind. <small>(Southampton, Dec. 1849.)</small></p>

<p class="tb">Since this was written the same idea has been
carried out, with far more eloquent reasoning, in a
noble passage which I have just found in Mr. Ruskin&#8217;s
last volume of &#8220;The Stones of Venice&#8221; (the
Sea Stories). As I do not <i>always</i> subscribe to his
theories of Art, I am the more delighted with this
anticipation of a moral agreement between us.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have much studied and much perfected of
late, the great civilised invention of the division of
labour, only we give it a false name. It is not, truly
speaking, the labour that is divided, but the men:&mdash;divided
into mere segments of men,&mdash;broken into
small fragments and crumbs of life; so that all the
little piece of intelligence that is left in a man is not
enough to make a pin or a nail, but exhausts itself
in making the point of a pin or the head of a nail.
Now, it is a good and desirable thing truly to make
many pins in a day, but if we could only see with
what crystal sand their points are polished&mdash;sand of
human soul, much to be magnified before it can be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
discerned for what it is,&mdash;we should think there
might be some loss in it also; and the great cry that
rises from all our manufacturing cities, louder than
their furnace-blast, is all in very deed for this,&mdash;that
we manufacture everything there except men,&mdash;we
blanch cotton, and strengthen steel, and refine
sugar, and shape pottery; but to brighten, to
strengthen, to refine, or to form a single living spirit,
never enters into our estimate of advantages; and
all the evil to which that cry is urging our myriads,
can be met only in one way,&mdash;not by teaching nor
preaching; for to teach them is but to show them
their misery; and to preach to them&mdash;if we do
nothing more than preach,&mdash;is to mock at it. It
can be met only by a right understanding on the
part of all classes, of what kinds of labour are good
for men, raising them and making them happy; by
a determined sacrifice of such convenience, or beauty
or cheapness, as is to be got only by the degradation
of the workman, and by equally determined demand
for the products and results of a healthy and ennobling
labour.&#8221; ...</p>

<p>&#8220;We are always in these days trying to separate
the two (intellect and work). We want one man
to be always thinking, and another to be always
working; and we call one a gentleman and the
other an operative; whereas, the workman ought to
be often thinking, and the thinker often working,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and both should be gentlemen in the best sense. It
is only by labour that thought can be made healthy,
and only by thought that labour can be made
happy; and the two cannot be separated with
impunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wordsworth, however, had said the same thing
before either of us:</p>

<p>And this leads us to the consideration of another
mistake, analogous with the above, but referable in
its results chiefly to the higher, or what Mr. Ruskin
calls the <i>thinking</i>, classes of the community.</p>

<p>It is not good for us to have all that we value
of worldly material things in the form of money.
It is the most vulgar form in which value can be invested.
Not only books, pictures, and all beautiful
things are better; but even jewels and trinkets are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
sometimes to be preferred to mere hard money. Lands
and tenements are good, as involving duties; but
still what is valuable in the market sense should
sometimes take the ideal and the beautiful form, and
be dear and lovely and valuable for its own sake as
well as for its convertible worth in hard gold. I
think the character would be apt to deteriorate when
all its material possessions take the form of money,
and when money becomes valuable for its own
sake, or as the mere instrument or representative
of power.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">e</span>
are told in a late account of Laura Bridgeman,
the blind, deaf, and dumb girl, that her

<p>&#8220;That which thinks, feels, hopes, loves,&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>aches</i>?&#8221; she added eagerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/illus-008.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="99" width="350" /></div>

<h5>5.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap"> was</span>
reading to-day in the Notes to Boswell&#8217;s
Life of Johnson that &#8220;it is a theory which every
one knows to be <i>false in fact</i>, that virtue in real life
is always productive of happiness, and vice of misery.&#8221;
I should say that all my experience teaches me that
the position is not false but true: that virtue <i>does</i>
produce happiness, and vice <i>does</i> produce misery.
But let us settle the meaning of the words. By
<i>happiness</i>, we do not necessarily mean a state of
worldly prosperity. By <i>virtue</i>, we do not mean a
series of good actions which may or may not be rewarded,
and, if done for reward, lose the essence of
virtue. Virtue, according to my idea, is the habitual
sense of right, and the habitual courage to act up to
that sense of right, combined with benevolent sympathies,
the charity which thinketh no evil. This
union of the highest conscience and the highest sympathy
fulfils my notion of virtue. Strength is essential
to it; weakness incompatible with it. Where
virtue is, the noblest faculties and the softest feelings
are predominant; the whole being is in that state of
harmony which I call happiness. Pain may reach it,
passion may disturb it, but there is always a glimpse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of blue sky above our head; as we ascend in dignity
of being, we ascend in happiness, which is, in my
sense of the word, the feeling which connects us
with the infinite and with God.</p>

<p>And vice is necessarily misery: for that fluctuation
of principle, that diseased craving for excitement,
that weakness out of which springs falsehood, that
suspicion of others, that discord with ourselves, with
the absence of the benevolent propensities,&mdash;these
constitute misery as a state of being. The most
miserable person I ever met with in my life had
12,000<i>l.</i> a year; a cunning mind, dexterous to compass
its own ends; very little conscience, not enough,
one would have thought, to vex with any retributive
pang; but it was the absence of goodness that made
the misery, obvious and hourly increasing. The
perpetual kicking against the pricks, the unreasonable
<i>exig&eacute;ance</i> with regard to things, without any high
standard with regard to persons,&mdash;these made the
misery. I can speak of it as misery who had it daily
in my sight for five long years.</p>

<p>I have had arguments, if it be not presumption to
call them so, with Carlyle on this point. It appeared
to me that he confounded happiness with pleasure,
with self-indulgence. He set aside with a towering
scorn the idea of living for the sake of happiness, so
called: he styled this philosophy of happiness, &#8220;the
philosophy of the frying-pan.&#8221; But this was like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the reasoning of a child, whose idea of happiness is
plenty of sugar-plums. Pleasure, pleasurable sensation,
is, as the world goes, something to thank God
for. I should be one of the last to undervalue it;
I hope I am one of the last to live for it; and pain
is pain, a great evil, which I do not like either to
inflict or suffer. But happiness lies beyond either
pain or pleasure&mdash;is as sublime a thing as virtue

not seem to acknowledge that &#8220;the wisdom that is

exclusively. All other things, though lying near,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>

<p>Yes, and no. What we <i>act</i> has its consequences
on earth. What we <i>think</i>, its consequences in heaven.
It is not without reason that action should
be preferred before barren thought; but all action
which in its result is worth any thing, must result
from thought. So the old rhymester hath it:</p>

<p>The result of impulse is the positive; the result
of consideration the negative. The positive is essentially
and abstractedly better than the negative,
though relatively to facts and circumstances it may
not be the most expedient.</p>

<p>On my observing how often I had had reason to regret
not having followed the first impulse, <span class="smcap">O. G.</span> said,
&#8220;In <i>good</i> minds the first impulses are generally
right and true, and, when altered or relinquished
from regard to expediency arising out of complicated
relations, I always feel sorry, for they remain right.
Our first impulses always lean to the positive, our
second thoughts to the negative; and I have no
respect for the negative,&mdash;it is the vulgar side of
every thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must be conceded, that one
who stands endowed with great power and with great
responsibilities in the midst of a thousand duties and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
interests, can no longer take things in this simple
fashion; for the good first impulse, in its flow, meets,
perhaps, some rock, and splits upon it; it recoils on
the heart, and becomes abortive. Or the impulse
to do good <i>here</i> becomes injury <i>there</i>, and we are
forced to calculate results; we cannot trust to them.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span>
is really sublime, this man! with his faith in
&#8220;the religion of pain,&#8221; and &#8220;the deification of
sorrow!&#8221; But is he therefore right? What has he
preached to us to-day with all the force of eloquence,
all the earnestness of conviction? that &#8220;pain is the
life of God as shown forth in Christ;&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;that we
are to be crucified to the world and the world to
us.&#8221; This perpetual presence of a crucified God
between us and a pitying redeeming Christ, leads
many a mourner to the belief that this world is all a
Golgotha of pain, and that we are here to crucify
each other. Is this the law under which we are to
live and strive? The missionary Bridaine accused
himself of sin in that he had preached fasting,
penance, and the chastisements of God to wretches
steeped in poverty and dying of hunger; and is
there not a similar cruelty and misuse of power in
the servants of Him who came to bind up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
broken-hearted, when they preach the necessity, or
at least the theory, of moral pain to those whose
hearts are aching from moral evil?</p>

<p>Surely there is a great difference between the
resignation or the endurance of a truthful, faithful,
loving, hopeful spirit, and this dreadful theology of
suffering as the necessary and appointed state of
things! I, for one, will not accept it. Even while
most miserable, I will believe in happiness; even
while I do or suffer evil, I will believe in goodness;
even while my eyes see not through tears, I will believe
in the existence of what I do not see&mdash;that
God is benign, that nature is fair, that the world is
not made as a prison or a penance. While I stand
lost in utter darkness, I will yet wait for the return
of the unfailing dawn,&mdash;even though my soul be
amazed into such a blind perplexity that I know not
on which side to look for it, and ask &#8220;where is the
East? and whence the dayspring?&#8221; For the East
holds its wonted place, and the light is withheld only
till its appointed time.</p>

<p>God so strengthen me that I may think of pain
and sin only as accidental apparent discords in his
great harmonious scheme of good! Then I am ready&mdash;I
will take up the cross, and hear it bravely, while
I <i>must</i>; but I will lay it down when I can, and in
any case I will never lay it on another.</p>

in fear of any spiritual or human being in whose
love I do not entirely believe. Of that Impersonation
of Evil, who goes about seeking whom he may
devour, the image brings to me no fear, only intense
disgust and aversion. Yes, it is because of his love
for me that I fear to offend against God; it is because
of his love that his displeasure must be terrible.
And with regard to human beings, only the
being I love has the power to give me pain or
inspire me with fear; only those in whose love I
believe, have the power to injure me. Take away
my love, and you take away my fear: take away
<i>their</i> love, and you take away the power to do me
any harm which can reach me in the sources of life

whose charities are more diffused, as well as healthier

<p>Wordsworth speaks strongly of the evils of ordaining
men as clergymen in places where they had been
born or brought up, or in the midst of their own
relatives: &#8220;Their habits, their manners, their talk,
their acquaintanceships, their friendships, and let me

point out another.&#8221; If this were true universally, or

selfishness; the very mischief which, above all others,
it would directly and immediately bring forth. There
is no selfishness where there is a wife and family.
There the house is lighted up by mutual charities;
everything achieved for them is a victory; everything
endured a triumph. How many vices are suppressed
that there may be no <i>bad</i> example! How
many exertions made to recommend and inculcate
a <i>good</i> one.&#8221;</p>

<p>True: and I have much more confidence in the
charity which begins in the home and diverges into a
large humanity, than in the world-wide philanthropy
which begins at the outside of our horizon to converge
into egotism, of which I could show you many

I do not think of my own destruction, rather of that

<p>&#8220;I conceive that in all probability we have
immortality already. Most men seem to divide life
and immortality, making them two distinct things,
when, in fact, they are one and the same. What is
immortality but a continuation of life&mdash;life which is
already our own? We have, then, begun our immortality
even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the same reason, or, rather, through the
same want of reasoning by which we make <i>life</i> and
<i>immortality</i> two (distinct things), do we make <i>time</i>
and <i>eternity</i> two, which like the others are really one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and the same. As immortality is but the continuation
of life, so eternity is but the continuation of
time; and what we call time is only that part of
eternity in which we exist <i>now</i>.&mdash;<i>The New Philosophy.</i></p>

<p>All love not responded to and accepted is a species

but cannot inspire with life, nor warm with sympathy.
No!&mdash;though we should consume our own
hearts on the altar. Our love of God would be idolatry
if we did not believe in his love for us&mdash;his

<p>In the same moment that we begin to speculate

<p>&#8220;Motives,&#8221; said Coleridge, &#8220;imply weakness,

act from impulse alone.&#8221; This is the sort of
angel which Angelico da Fiesole conceived and
represented, and <i>he</i> only.</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;&#8220;If a man&#8217;s conduct can neither be
ascribed to the angelic or the bestial within him, it
must be fiendish. Passion without appetite is
<i>fiendish</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, he might have added, appetite without
passion, <i>bestial</i>. Love in which is neither appetite
nor passion is <i>angelic</i>. The union of all is human;
and according as one or other predominates, does the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>

One great fault in education is, the pains taken to

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">t</span> dinner to-day there was an attempt made
by two very clever men to place Theodore Hook
above Sydney Smith. I fought with all my might
against both. It seems to me that a mind must be
strangely warped that could ever place on a par
two men with aspirations and purposes so different,
whether we consider them merely as individuals, or
called before the bar of the public as writers. I
do not take to Sydney Smith personally, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
my nature feels the want of the artistic and imaginative
in <i>his</i> nature; but see what he has done for
humanity, for society, for liberty, for truth,&mdash;for
us women! What has Theodore Hook done that
has not perished with him? Even as wits&mdash;and
I have been in company with both&mdash;I could not
compare them; but they say the wit of Theodore
Hook was only fitted for the company of men&mdash;the
strongest proof that it was not genuine of its kind,
that when most bearable, it was most superficial. I
set aside the other obvious inference, that it required
to be excited by stimulants and those of the coarsest,
grossest kind. The wit of Sydney Smith almost
always involved a thought worth remembering for
its own sake, as well as worth remembering for its
brilliant vehicle: the value of ten thousand pounds
sterling of sense concentrated into a cut and polished
diamond.</p>

<p>It is not true, as I have heard it said, that after
leaving the society of Sydney Smith you only remembered
how much you had laughed, not the good
things at which you had laughed. Few men&mdash;wits
by profession&mdash;ever said so many memorable things
as those recorded of Sydney Smith.</p>

so popular, so passionately admired at the
time it appeared&mdash;just after the seven years&#8217; war,&mdash;helped
to render Lord Byron so popular in his time.
It was not the individuality of &#8220;Werther,&#8221; nor the
individuality of &#8220;Childe Harold&#8221; which produced
the effect of making them, for a time, a pervading
power,&mdash;a <i>part</i> of the life of their contemporaries.
It was because in both cases a chord was struck
which was ready to vibrate. A phase of feeling preexistent,
palpitating at the heart of society, which
had never found expression in any poetic form since
the days of Dante, was made visible and audible as
if by an electric force; words and forms were given
to a diffused sentiment of pain and resistance, caused
by a long period of war, of political and social
commotion, and of unhealthy moral excitement.
&#8220;Werther&#8221; and &#8220;Childe Harold&#8221; will never perish;
because, though they have ceased to be the echo
of a wide despair, there will always be, unhappily,
individual minds and hearts to respond to the individuality.</p>

<p>Lord Byron has sometimes, to use his own expression,
&#8220;curdled&#8221; a whole world of meaning into
the compass of one line:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here every word, almost every syllable, paints an

</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>In general, where words are used in description,
the objects and ideas flow with the words in succession.
But in each of these lines the mind takes in a
wide horizon, comprising a multitude of objects at
once, as the eye takes in a picture, with scene, and
action, and figures, fore-ground and background, all
at once. That is the reason I call such lines <i>picturesque</i>.</p>

somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or

our way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or

this respect children, half-educated women, and ill-educated
men, are the &#8220;common people.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is one of the most serious mistakes in Education
that we are not sufficiently careful to habituate children
to the accurate use of words. Accuracy of
language is one of the bulwarks of truth. If we
looked into the matter we should probably find that
all the varieties and modifications of conscious and
unconscious lying&mdash;as exaggeration, equivocation,
evasion, misrepresentation&mdash;might be traced to the
early misuse of words; therefore the contemptuous,
careless tone in which people say sometimes &#8220;words&mdash;words&mdash;mere
words!&#8221; is unthinking and unwise.
It tends to debase the value of that which is the only
medium of the inner life between man and man:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> &#8220;Nous
ne sommes hommes, et nous ne tenons les
uns aux autres, que par la parole,&#8221; said Montaigne.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;W</span><span class="smcap">e</span> are happy, good, tranquil, in proportion as
our inner life is accessible to the external life,
and in harmony with it. When we become dead to
the moving life of Nature around us, to the changes
of day and night (I do not speak here of the sympathetic
influences of our fellow-creatures), then we
may call ourselves philosophical, but we are surely
either bad or mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or perhaps only sad?&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">There are moments in the life of every contemplative
being, when the healing power of Nature
is felt&mdash;even as Wordsworth describes it&mdash;felt in
the blood, in every pulse along the veins. In such
moments converse, sympathy, the faces, the presence
of the dearest, come so near to us, they make us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
shrink; books, pictures, music, anything, any object
which has passed through the medium of mind, and
has been in a manner humanised, is felt as an intrusive
reflection of the busy, weary, thought-worn
self within us. Only Nature, speaking through no
interpreter, gently steals us out of our humanity,
giving us a foretaste of that more diffused disembodied
life which may hereafter be ours. Beautiful
and genial, and not wholly untrue, were the old
superstitions which placed a haunting divinity in
every grove, and heard a living voice responsive in
every murmuring stream.</p>

<p class="tb">This present Sunday I set off with the others to
walk to church, but it was late; I could not keep
up with the pedestrians, and, not to delay them,
turned back. I wandered down the hill path to the
river brink, and crossed the little bridge and strolled
along, pensive yet with no definite or continuous
subject of thought. How beautiful it was&mdash;how
tranquil! not a cloud in the blue sky, not a breath
of air! &#8220;And where the dead leaf fell there did it
rest;&#8221; but so still it was that scarce a single leaf did
flutter or fall, though the narrow pathway along the
water&#8217;s edge was already encumbered with heaps of
decaying foliage. Everywhere around, the autumnal
tints prevailed, except in one sheltered place under
the towering cliff, where a single tree, a magnificent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
lime, still flourished in summer luxuriance, with not
a leaf turned or shed. I stood still opposite, looking
on it quietly for a long time. It seemed to me a
happy tree, so fresh and fair and grand, as if its
guardian Dryad would not suffer it to be defaced.
Then I turned, for close beside me sounded the soft,
interrupted, half-suppressed warble of a bird, sitting
on a leafless spray, which seemed to bend with its
tiny weight. Some lines which I used to love in
my childhood came into my mind, blending softly
with the presences around me.</p>

<p>The river, where I stood, taking an abrupt turn,
ran wimpling by; not as I had seen it but a few
days before,&mdash;rolling tumultuously, the dead leaves
whirling in its eddies, swollen and turbid with the
mountain torrents, making one think of the kelpies,
the water wraiths, and such uncanny things,&mdash;but
gentle, transparent, and flashing in the low sunlight;
even the barberries, drooping with rich crimson
clusters over the little pools near the bank, and reflected
in them as in a mirror, I remember vividly as
a part of the exquisite loveliness which seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> I told Tieck of the death of Coleridge (I
had just received the sad but not unexpected
news in a letter from England), he exclaimed with
emotion, &#8220;A great spirit has passed away from the
earth, and has left no adequate memorial of its greatness.&#8221;
Speaking of him afterwards he said, &#8220;Coleridge
possessed the creative and inventive spirit of
poetry, not the productive; he <i>thought</i> too much to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
produce,&mdash;the analytical power interfered with the
genius: Others with more active faculties seized and
worked out his magnificent hints and ideas. Walter
Scott and Lord Byron borrowed the first idea of the
form and spirit of their narrative poems from
Coleridge&#8217;s &#8216;Christabelle.&#8217;&#8221; This judgment of one
great poet and critic passed on another seemed to me

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smcap">oleridge</span> says, &#8220;In politics what begins in fear

<p>He might have gone farther, and added: In morals
what begins in fear usually ends in wickedness. In
religion what begins in fear usually ends in fanaticism.
Fear, either as a principle or a motive, is the
beginning of all evil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talent lying in the understanding is often inherited;
genius, being the action of reason and
imagination, rarely or never.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>There seems confusion here, for genius lies not
in the amount of intellect&mdash;it is a quality of the
intellect apart from quantity. And the distinction
between talent and genius is definite. Talent combines
and uses; genius combines and creates.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">e</span> all remember the famous <i>bon mot</i> of Talleyrand.
When seated between Madame de Sta&euml;l and
Madame R&eacute;camier, and pouring forth gallantry, first
at the feet of one, then of the other, Madame de Sta&euml;l
suddenly asked him if she and Madame R&eacute;camier
fell into the river, which of the two he would save
first? &#8220;Madame,&#8221; replied Talleyrand, &#8220;je crois que
vous savez nager!&#8221; Now we will match this
pretty <i>bon mot</i> with one far prettier, and founded on
it. Prince S., whom I knew formerly, was one day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
loitering on the banks of the Isar, in the English
garden at Munich, by the side of the beautiful
Madame de V., then the object of his devoted admiration.
For a while he had been speaking to her
of his mother, for whom, <i>vaurien</i> as he was, he
had ever shown the strongest filial love and respect.
Afterwards, as they wandered on, he began to pour
forth his soul to the lady of his love with all the
eloquence of passion. Suddenly she turned and said
to him, &#8220;If your mother and myself were both to
fall into this river, whom would you save first?&#8221;
&#8220;My mother!&#8221; he instantly replied; and then, looking
at her expressively, immediately added, &#8220;To
save <i>you</i> first would be as if I were to save <i>myself</i>
first!&#8221;</p>

<p>But to be true to others as well as ourselves, is
not merely to allow to them the same independence,
but to sympathise with it. Unhappily here lies the
chief difficulty. There are brains so large that they
unconsciously swamp all individualities which come
in contact or too near, and brains so small that they
cannot take in the conception of any other individuality
as a whole, only in part or parts. As in
Religion, where there is a strong, sincere, definite
faith, there is generally more or less intolerance; so
in character, where there is strong individuality,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
self-assurance, and defined principles of action, there
is usually something hard and intolerant of the individuality
of others. In some characters we meet
with, toleration is a principle of the reason, and
intolerance a quality of the mind, and then the
whole being strikes a discord.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> are few things more striking, more interesting
to a thoughtful mind, than to trace
through all the poetry, literature, and art of the
Middle Ages that broad ever-present distinction between
the practical and the contemplative life. This
was, no doubt, suggested and kept in view by the one
grand division of the whole social community into
those who were devoted to the religious profession
(an immense proportion of both sexes) and those who
were not. All through Dante, all through the
productions of medi&aelig;val art, we find this pervading
idea; and we must understand it well and keep
it in mind, or we shall never be able to apprehend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the entire beauty and meaning of certain
religious groups in sculpture and painting, and the
significance of the characters introduced. Thus,
in subjects from the Old Testament, Leah always
represents the practical, Rachel, the contemplative
life. In the New Testament, Martha and Mary
figure in the same allegorical sense; and among
the saints we always find St. Catharine and St.
Clara patronising the religious and contemplative
life, while St. Barbara and St. Ursula preside
over the military or secular existence. It was
a part, and a very important part, of that beautiful
and expressive symbolism through which art in all
its forms spoke to the popular mind.</p>

<p>For myself, I have the strongest admiration for
the <i>practical</i>, but the strongest sympathy with the
<i>contemplative</i> life. I bow to Leah and to Martha,
but my love is for Rachel and for Mary.</p>

of cunning. That &#8220;pleasure in deceiving and aptness
to be deceived&#8221; usually go together, was one of
the wise sayings of the wisest of men.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was a saying of Paracelsus, that &#8220;Those who
would understand the course of the heavens above
must first of all recognise the heaven in man:&#8221;
meaning, I suppose, that all pursuit of knowledge
which is not accompanied by praise of God and love
of our fellow-creatures must turn to bitterness,
emptiness, foolishness. We must imagine him to
have come to this conclusion only late in life.</p>

<p>Browning, in that wonderful poem of Paracelsus,&mdash;a
poem in which there is such a profound
far-seeing philosophy, set forth with such a luxuriance
of illustration and imagery, and such a wealth
of glorious eloquence, that I know nothing to be
compared with it since Goethe and Wordsworth,&mdash;represents
his aspiring philosopher as at first impelled
solely by the appetite to <i>know</i>. He asks
nothing of men, he despises them; but he will serve
them, raise them, after a sort of God-like fashion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
independent of their sympathy, scorning their applause,
using them like instruments, cheating them
like children,&mdash;all for their good; but it will not do.
In Aprile, &#8220;who would love infinitely, and be beloved,&#8221;
is figured the type of the poet-nature, desiring
only beauty, resolving all into beauty; while
in Paracelsus we have the type of the reflecting, the
inquiring mind desiring only knowledge, resolving
all into knowledge, asking nothing more to crown
his being. And both find out their mistake; both
come to feel that love without knowledge is blind
and weak, and knowledge without love barren and
vain.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smcap">ord Bacon</span> says: &#8220;I like a plantation (in the
sense of colony) in a <i>pure</i> soil; that is, where
people are not displanted to the end to plant in
others: for else it is rather an extirpation than a
plantation.&#8221; (Bacon, who wrote this, counselled to
James I. the plantation of Ulster exactly on the
principle he has here deprecated.)</p>

<p>He adds, &#8220;It is a shameful and unblessed thing to
take the scum of people, and wicked condemned men,
to be the people with whom you plant&#8221; (<i>i. e.</i> colonise).
And it is only now that our politicians are
beginning to discover and act upon this great moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
truth and obvious fitness of things!&mdash;like Bacon,
adopting practically, and from mere motives of expediency,
a principle they would theoretically abjure!</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smcap">ecause</span> in real life we cannot, or do not, reconcile
the high theory with the low practice,
we use our wit to render the theory ridiculous, and
our reason to reconcile us to the practice. We ought
to do just the reverse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/illus-008.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="99" width="350" /></div>

<p>Many would say, if they spoke the truth, that it
had cost them a life-long effort to unlearn what they
had been taught.</p>

<p>For as the eye becomes blinded by fashion to
positive deformity, so through social conventionalism
the conscience becomes blinded to positive
immorality.</p>

<p>It is fatal in any mind to make the moral standard
for men high and the moral standard for women low,
or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. This has appeared to me the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
commonest of all mistakes in men and women who
have lived much in the world, but <i>fatal</i> nevertheless,
and in three ways; first, as distorting the moral
ideal, so far as it exists in the conscience; secondly,
as perplexing the bounds, practically, of right and
wrong; thirdly, as being at variance with the spirit
and principles of Christianity. Admit these premises,
and it follows inevitably that such a mistake
is <i>fatal</i> in the last degree, as disturbing the consistency
and the elevation of the character, morally,
practically, religiously.</p>

<p class="tb">Akin to this mistake, or identical with it, is the
belief that there are essential masculine and feminine
virtues and vices. It is not, in fact, the quality
itself, but the modification of the quality, which is
masculine or feminine: and on the manner or degree
in which these are balanced and combined in the
individual, depends the perfection of that individual
character&mdash;its approximation to that of Christ.
I firmly believe that as the influences of religion are
extended, and as civilisation advances, those qualities
which are now admired as essentially <i>feminine</i> will be
considered as essentially <i>human</i>, such as gentleness,
purity, the more unselfish and spiritual sense of
duty, and the dominance of the affections over the
passions. This is, perhaps, what Buffon, speaking
as a naturalist, meant, when he said that with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
progress of humanity, &#8220;<i>Les races se f&eacute;minisent</i>;&#8221;
at least I understand the phrase in this sense.</p>

<p class="tb">A man who requires from his own sex manly
direct truth, and laughs at the cowardly subterfuges
and small arts of women as being <i>feminine</i>;&mdash;a
woman who requires from her own sex tenderness
and purity, and thinks ruffianism and sensuality
pardonable in a man as being <i>masculine</i>,&mdash;these
have repudiated the Christian standard of morals
which Christ, in his own person, bequeathed to us&mdash;that
standard which we have accepted as Christians&mdash;theoretically
at least&mdash;and which makes no distinction
between &#8220;the highest, holiest manhood,&#8221;
and the highest, holiest womanhood.</p>

<p>I might illustrate this position not only scripturally
but philosophically, by quoting the axiom of
the Greek philosopher Antisthenes, the disciple of
Socrates,&mdash;&#8220;The virtue of the man and the woman
is the same;&#8221; which shows a perception of the moral
truth, a sort of anticipation of the Christian doctrine,
even in the pagan times. But I prefer an
illustration which is at once practical and poetical,
and plain to the most prejudiced among men or
women.</p>

<p>Every reader of Wordsworth will recollect, if he
does not know by heart, the poem entitled &#8220;The
Happy Warrior.&#8221; It has been quoted often as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
epitome of every manly, soldierly, and elevated
quality. I have heard it applied to the Duke of
Wellington. Those who make the experiment of
merely substituting the word <i>woman</i> for the word
<i>warrior</i>, and changing the feminine for the masculine
pronoun, will find that it reads equally well;
that almost from beginning to end it is literally
as applicable to the one sex as to the other. As
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>No woman could exist happily or virtuously in
such complete independence of all external affections
as these words express. &#8220;Her desire is to her husband,&#8221;&mdash;this
is the sort of subjection prophesied for
the daughters of Eve. A woman doomed to exist
without this earthly rest for her affections, does not
&#8220;in herself possess her own desire;&#8221; she turns
towards God; and if she does not make her life a
life of worship, she makes it a life of charity, (which
in itself is worship,) or she dies a spiritual and a
moral death. Is it much better with the man who
concentrates his aspirations in himself? I should
think not.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/illus-008.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="99" width="350" /></div>

<p>Swift, as a man and a writer, is one of those who
had least sympathy with women; and I have sometimes
thought that the exaggeration, even to morbidity,
of the coarse and the cruel in his character,
arose from this want of sympathy; but his strong
sense showed him the one great moral truth as
regards the two sexes, and gave him the courage to
avow it.</p>

<p>He says, &#8220;I am ignorant of any one quality that
is amiable in a woman which is not equally so in a
man. I do not except even modesty and gentleness
of nature; nor do I know one vice or folly which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
not equally detestable in both.&#8221; Then, remarking
that cowardice is an <i>infirmity</i> generally allowed to
women, he wonders that they should fancy it becoming
or graceful, or think it worth improving by
affectation, particularly as it is generally allied to
cruelty.</p>

<p class="tb">Here is a passage from one of Humboldt&#8217;s letters,
which I have seen quoted with sympathy and admiration,
as applied to the manly character only:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Masculine independence of mind I hold to be
in reality the first requisite for the formation of a
character of real manly worth. The man who suffers
himself to be deceived and carried away by his own
weakness, may be a very amiable person in other
respects, but cannot be called a good man; such
beings should not find favour in the eyes of a woman,
for a truly beautiful and purely feminine nature
should be attracted only by what is highest and
noblest in the character of man.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">Now we will take this bit of moral philosophy,
and, without the slightest alteration of the context,
apply it to the female character.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feminine independence of mind I hold to be
in reality the first requisite for the formation of a
character of real feminine worth. The woman who
allows herself to be deceived and carried away by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
her own weakness may be a very amiable person in
other respects, but cannot be called a good woman;
such beings should not find favour in the eyes of a
man, for the truly beautiful and purely manly nature
should be attracted only by what is highest and
noblest in the character of woman.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">After reading the above extracts, does it not seem
clear, that by the exclusive or emphatic use of certain
phrases and epithets, as more applicable to one sex
than to the other, we have introduced a most un-christian
confusion into the conscience, and have
prejudiced it early against the acceptance of the
larger truth?</p>

<p>It might seem, that where we reject the distinction
between masculine and feminine virtues, one
and the same type of perfection should suffice for
the two sexes; yet it is clear that the moment we
come to consider the personality, the same type will
not suffice: and it is worth consideration that when
we place before us the highest type of manhood, as
exemplified in Christ, we do not imagine him as the
father, but as the son; and if we think of the most
perfect type of womanhood, we never can exclude
the mother.</p>

<p class="tb">Montaigne deals with the whole question in his
own homely straightforward fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Je dis que les m&acirc;les et les f&eacute;melles sont jett&eacute;s en
m&ecirc;me moule; sauf l&#8217;institution et l&#8217;usage la diff&eacute;rence
n&#8217;y est pas grande. Platon appelle indiff&eacute;remment
les uns et les autres &agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de touts &eacute;tudes,
exercises, charges, et vocations guerri&egrave;res et paisibles
en sa r&eacute;publique, et le philosophe Antisth&egrave;nes &ocirc;tait
toute distinction entre leur vertu et la n&ocirc;tre. Il est
bien plus ais&eacute; d&#8217;accuser un sexe que d&#8217;excuser
l&#8217;autre: c&#8217;est ce qu&#8217;on dit, &#8216;le fourgon se moque de
la po&euml;le.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Not that I agree with Plato,&mdash;rather would
leave all the fighting, military and political, if there
must be fighting, to the men.</p>

<p>Among the absurdities talked about women, one
hears, perhaps, such an aphorism as the following
quoted with a sort of ludicrous complacency,&mdash;&#8220;The
woman&#8217;s strength consists in her weakness!&#8221; as if it
were not the weakness of a woman which makes her
in her violence at once so aggravating and so contemptible,
in her dissimulation at once so shallow
and so dangerous, and in her vengeance at once so
cowardly and so cruel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/illus-008.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="99" width="350" /></div>

<p>I should not say, from my experience of my own
sex, that a woman&#8217;s nature is flexible and impressible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
though her feelings are. I know very few instances
of a very inferior man ruling the mind of a superior
woman, whereas I know twenty&mdash;fifty&mdash;of a very
inferior woman ruling a superior man. If he love
her, the chances are that she will in the end weaken
and demoralise him. If a superior woman marry a
vulgar or inferior man he makes her miserable, but
he seldom governs her mind, or vulgarises her
nature, and if there be love on his side the chances
are that in the end she will elevate and refine him.</p>

<p>The most dangerous man to a woman is a man of
high intellectual endowments morally perverted; for
in a woman&#8217;s nature there is such a necessity to
approve where she admires, and to believe where
she loves,&mdash;a devotion compounded of love and
faith is so much a part of her being,&mdash;that while
the instincts remain true and the feelings uncorrupted,
the conscience and the will may both be led
far astray. Thus fell &#8220;our general mother,&#8221;&mdash;type
of her sex,&mdash;overpowered, rather than deceived, by
the colossal intellect,&mdash;half serpent, half angelic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/illus-008.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="99" width="350" /></div>

<p>Coleridge speaks, and with a just indignant
scorn, of those who consider chastity as if it were a
<i>thing</i>&mdash;a thing which might be lost or kept by
external accident&mdash;a thing of which one might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
robbed, instead of a state of being. According to
law and custom, the chastity of Woman is as the
property of Man, to whom she is accountable for it,
rather than to God and her own conscience. Whatever
people may say, such is the common, the social,
the legal view of the case. It is a remnant of
Oriental barbarism. It tends to much vice, or, at
the best, to a low standard of morality, in both
sexes. This idea of property in the woman survives
still in our present social state, particularly among
the lower orders, and is one cause of the ill treatment
of wives. All those who are particularly
acquainted with the manners and condition of the
people will testify to this; namely, that when a
child or any weaker individual is ill treated, those
standing by will interfere and protect the victim;
but if the sufferer be <i>the wife</i> of the oppressor, it is a
point of etiquette to look on, to take no part in the
fray, and to leave the brute man to do what he likes
&#8220;with his own.&#8221; Even the victim herself, if she be
not pummelled to death, frequently deprecates such
an interference with the dignity and the rights of
her owner. Like the poor woman in the &#8220;M&eacute;decin
malgr&eacute; lui:&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Voyez un peu cet impertinent qui
vent emp&ecirc;cher les maris de battre leurs femmes!&mdash;et
si je veux qu&#8217;il me batte, moi?&#8221;&mdash;and so ends by
giving her defender a box on the ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Au milieu de tous les obstacles que la nature et
la soci&eacute;t&eacute; out sem&eacute;s sur les pas de la femme, la seule
condition de repos pour elle est de s&#8217;entourer de
barri&egrave;res que les passions ne puissent franchir; incapable
de s&#8217;approprier l&#8217;existence, elle est toujours
semblable a la Chinoise dont les pieds ont &eacute;t&eacute; mutil&eacute;s
et pour laquelle toute libert&eacute; est un leurre, toute
espace ouverte une cause de chute. En attendant

<p>This also is one of those common-places of well-sounding
eloquence, in which a fallacy is so wrapt
up in words we have to dig it out. If this be true,
it is true only so long as you compress the feet and

<p>A friend of mine was once using some mincing
elegancies of language to describe a high degree of
moral turpitude, when a man near her interposed,
with stern sarcasm, &#8220;Speak out! Give things their
proper names! <i>Half words are the perdition of
women!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I observe,&#8221; said Sydney Smith, &#8220;that <i>generally</i>
about the age of forty, women get tired of being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
virtuous and men of being honest.&#8221; This was said
and received with a laugh as one of his good things;
but, like many of his good things, how dreadfully
true! And why? because, <i>generally</i>, education has
made the virtue of the woman and the honesty of the
man a matter of external opinion, not a law of the
inward life.</p>

<p>Inveterate sensuality, which has the effect of
utterly stupifying and brutifying lower minds, gives
to natures more sensitively or more powerfully organised
a horrible dash of ferocity. For there is
an awful relation between animal blood-thirstiness
and the proneness to sensuality, and in some sensualists
a sort of feline propensity to torment and
lacerate the prey they have not the appetite to
devour.</p>

Children cry from grief, and from sympathy with
grief, at a very early age. I have seen an infant in
its mother&#8217;s arms, before it could speak, begin to
whimper and cry when it looked up in her face,
which was disturbed and bathed with tears; and that
has always appeared to me an exquisite touch of

the desolation of Margaret:&mdash;</p>

sure to conquer in the end, it is not worth while
to fight every separate lie, or fling a torch into every
infected hole. Perhaps not, so far as we are ourselves
concerned; but we should think of others.
While secure in our own antidote, or wise in our
own caution, we should not leave the miasma to
poison the healthful, or the briars to entangle the
unwary. There is no occasion perhaps for truth to
sally forth like a knight-errant tilting at every vizor,
but neither should she sit self-assured in her tower
of strength, leaving pitfalls outside her gate for the
blind to fall into.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a way to separate memory from imagination&mdash;we
may narrate without painting.
I am convinced that the mind can employ certain
indistinct signs to represent even its most vivid
impressions; that instead of picture writing, it can
use something like algebraic symbols: such is the
language of the soul when the paroxysm of pain has
passed, and the wounds it received formerly are
skinned over, not healed:&mdash;it is a language very
opposite to that used by the poet and the novel-writer.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Blanco
White.</i></p>

<p>True; but a language in which the soul can converse
only with itself; or else a language more conventional
than words, and like paper as a tender for
gold, more capable of being defaced and falsified.
There is a proverb we have heard quoted: &#8220;Speech
is silver, silence is golden.&#8221; But better is the silver
diffused than the talent of gold buried.</p>

external relations with, society there is ever a levelling
influence at work. Seldom in our relations with the
world, and in the ordinary commerce of life, are the
best and highest within us brought forth; for the
whole system of social intercourse is levelling. As
it is said that law knows no distinction of persons
but that which it has itself instituted; so of society
it may be said, that it allows of no distinction but
those which it can recognise&mdash;external distinctions.</p>

<p>We hear it said that general society&mdash;the <i>world</i>,
as it is called&mdash;and a public school, are excellent
educators; because in one the man, in the other the
boy, &#8220;finds, as the phrase is, his own level.&#8221; He
does not; he finds the level of others. <i>That</i> may
be good for those below mediocrity, but for those
above it <i>bad</i>: and it is for those we should most
care, for if once brought down in early life by the
levelling influence of numbers, they seldom rise
again, or only partially. Nothing so dangerous as
to be perpetually measuring ourselves against what
is beneath us, feeling our superiority to that which
we force ourselves to assimilate to. This has been
the perdition of many a schoolboy and many a man.</p>

<h4>A REVELATION OF CHILDHOOD.</h4>

<h5>(FROM A LETTER.)</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">e</span> are all interested in this great question of
popular education; but I see others much
more sanguine than I am. They hope for some immediate
good result from all that is thought, written,
spoken on the subject day after day. I see such
results as possible, probable, but far, far off. All
this talk is of systems and methods, institutions,
school houses, schoolmasters, schoolmistresses, school
books; the ways and the means by which we are to
instruct, inform, manage, mould, regulate, that
which lies in most cases beyond our reach&mdash;the
spirit sent from God. What do we know of the
mystery of child-nature, child-life? What, indeed,
do we know of any life? All life we acknowledge
to be an awful mystery, but child-life we treat as if
it were no mystery whatever&mdash;just so much material
placed in our hands to be fashioned to a certain
form according to our will or our prejudices,&mdash;fitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
to certain purposes according to our notions of expediency.
Till we know how to <i>reverence</i> childhood we
shall do no good. Educators commit the same mistake
with regard to childhood that theologians
commit with regard to our present earthly existence;
thinking of it, treating of it, as of little value or
significance in itself, only transient, and preparatory
to some condition of being which is to follow&mdash;as if
it were something separate from us and to be left
behind us as the creature casts its skin. But as in
the sight of God this life is also something for its
own sake, so in the estimation of Christ, childhood
was something for its own sake,&mdash;something holy
and beautiful in itself, and dear to him. He saw it
not merely as the germ of something to grow out of
it, but as perfect and lovely in itself as the flower
which precedes the fruit. We misunderstand childhood,
and we misuse it; we delight in it, and we
pamper it; we spoil it ingeniously, we neglect it
sinfully; at the best we trifle with it as a plaything
which we can pull to pieces and put together at
pleasure&mdash;ignorant, reckless, presumptuous that we
are!</p>

<p>And if we are perpetually making the grossest
mistakes in the physical and practical management
of childhood, how much more in regard to what is
spiritual! What do we know of that which lies in
the minds of children? we know only what we put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
there. The world of instincts, perceptions, experiences,
pleasures, and pains, lying there without self-consciousness,&mdash;sometimes
helplessly mute, sometimes
so imperfectly expressed, that we quite
mistake the manifestation&mdash;what do we know of all
this? How shall we come at the understanding of
it? The child lives, and does not contemplate its
own life. It can give no account of that inward,
busy, perpetual activity of the growing faculties and
feelings which it is of so much importance that we
should know. To lead children by questionings to
think about their own identity, or observe their own
feelings, is to teach them to be artificial. To waken
self-consciousness before you awaken conscience is
the beginning of incalculable mischief. Introspection
is always, as a habit, unhealthy: introspection
in childhood, fatally so. How shall we come at a
knowledge of life such as it is when it first gushes
from its mysterious fountain head? We cannot reascend
the stream. We all, however we may remember
the external scenes lived through in our
infancy, either do not, or cannot, consult that part
of our nature which remains indissolubly connected
with the inward life of that time. We so forget it,
that we know not how to deal with the child-nature
when it comes under our power. We seldom reason
about children from natural laws, or psychological
data. Unconsciously we confound our matured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
experience with our memory: we attribute to children
what is not possible, exact from them what is
impossible;&mdash;ignore many things which the child
has neither words to express, nor the will nor the
power to manifest. The quickness with which children
perceive, the keenness with which they suffer,
the tenacity with which they remember, I have
never seen fully appreciated. What misery we
cause to children, what mischief we do them by
bringing our own minds, habits, artificial prejudices
and senile experiences, to bear on their young life,
and cramp and overshadow it&mdash;it is fearful!</p>

<p>Of all the wrongs and anomalies that afflict our
earth, a sinful childhood, a suffering childhood, are
among the worst.</p>

<p>O ye men! who sit in committees, and are called
upon to legislate for children,&mdash;for children who are
the offspring of diseased or degenerate humanity,
or the victims of a yet more diseased society,&mdash;do
you, when you take evidence from jailors, and policemen,
and parish schoolmasters, and doctors of divinity,
do you ever call up, also, the wise physician,
the thoughtful physiologist, the experienced mother?
You have accumulated facts, great blue books full of
facts, but till you know in what fixed and uniform
principles of nature to seek their solution, your facts
remain a dead letter.</p>

<p>I say nothing here of teaching, though very few
in truth understand that lowest part of our duty to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
children. Men, it is generally allowed, <i>teach</i> better
than women because they have been better taught
the things they teach. Women <i>train</i> better than
men because of their quick instinctive perceptions
and sympathies, and greater tenderness and patience.
In schools and in families I would have some things
taught by men, and some by women: but we will
here put aside the art, the act of teaching: we will
turn aside from the droves of children in national
schools and reformatory asylums, and turn to the
individual child, brought up within the guarded
circle of a home or a select school, watched by an
intelligent, a conscientious influence. How shall we
deal with that spirit which has come out of nature&#8217;s
hands unless we remember what we were ourselves
in the past? What sympathy can we have with
that state of being which we regard as immature,
so long as we commit the double mistake of sometimes
attributing to children motives which could
only spring from our adult experience, and sometimes
denying to them the same intuitive tempers and
feelings which actuate and agitate our maturer life?
We do not sufficiently consider that our life is not
made up of separate parts, but is <i>one</i>&mdash;is a progressive
whole. When we talk of leaving our
childhood behind us, we might as well say that the
river flowing onward to the sea had left the fountain
behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<h5>121.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">will</span> here put together some recollections of my
own child-life; not because it was in any respect
an exceptional or remarkable existence, but
for a reason exactly the reverse, because it was like
that of many children; at least I have met with
many children who throve or suffered from the same
or similar unseen causes even under external conditions
and management every way dissimilar.
Facts, therefore, which can be relied on, may be
generally useful as hints towards a theory of conduct
in education. What I shall say here shall be simply
the truth so far as it goes; not something between
the false and the true, garnished for effect,&mdash;not
something half-remembered, half-imagined,&mdash;but
plain, absolute, matter of fact.</p>

<p>No; certainly I was not an extraordinary child.
I have had something to do with children, and have
met with several more remarkable for quickness of
talent, and precocity of feeling. If any thing in
particular, I believe I was particularly naughty,&mdash;at
least so it was said twenty times a day. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
looking back now, I do not think I was particular
even in this respect; I perpetrated not more than
the usual amount of mischief&mdash;so called&mdash;which
every lively active child perpetrates between five
and ten years old. I had the usual desire to know,
and the usual dislike to learn; the usual love of
fairy tales, and hatred of French exercises. But
not of what I learned, but of what I did <i>not</i> learn;
not of what they taught me, but of what they could
<i>not</i> teach me; not of what was open, apparent,
manageable, but of the under current, the hidden,
the unmanaged or unmanageable, I have to speak,
and you, my friend, to hear and turn to account, if
you will, and how you will. As we grow old the
experiences of infancy come back upon us with a
strange vividness. There is a period when the overflowing,
tumultuous life of our youth rises up
between us and those first years; but as the torrent
subsides in its bed we can look across the impassable
gulf to that haunted fairy land which we shall never
more approach, and never more forget!</p>

<p class="tb">In memory I can go back to a very early age.
I perfectly remember being sung to sleep, and can
remember even the tune which was sung to me&mdash;blessings
on the voice that sang it! I was an affectionate,
but not, as I now think, a loveable nor an
attractive child. I did not, like the little Mozart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
ask of every one around me, &#8220;Do you love me?&#8221;
The instinctive question was, rather, &#8220;Can I love
you?&#8221; Yet certainly I was not more than six years
old when I suffered from the fear of not being loved
where I had attached myself, and from the idea that
another was preferred before me, such anguish as had
nearly killed me. Whether those around me regarded
it as a fit of ill-temper, or a fit of illness, I do
not know. I could not then have given a name to
the pang that fevered me. I knew not the cause,
but never forgot the suffering. It left a deeper impression
than childish passions usually do; and the
recollection was so far salutary, that in after life I
guarded myself against the approaches of that hateful,
deformed, agonising thing which men call jealousy,
as I would from an attack of cramp or cholera.
If such self-knowledge has not saved me from the
pain, at least it has saved me from the demoralising
effects of the passion, by a wholesome terror, and
even a sort of disgust.</p>

<p>With a good temper, there was the capacity of
strong, deep, silent resentment, and a vindictive
spirit of rather a peculiar kind. I recollect that
when one of those set over me inflicted what
then appeared a most horrible injury and injustice,
the thoughts of vengeance haunted my fancy
for months: but it was an inverted sort of vengeance.
I imagined the house of my enemy on fire,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
and rushed through the flames to rescue her. She
was drowning, and I leaped into the deep water to
draw her forth. She was pining in prison, and I
forced bars and bolts to deliver her. If this were
magnanimity, it was not the less vengeance; for,
observe, I always fancied evil, and shame, and humiliation
to my adversary; to myself the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of superiority
and gratified pride. For several years this
sort of burning resentment against wrong done to
myself and others, though it took no mean or cruel
form, was a source of intense, untold suffering. No
one was aware of it. I was left to settle it; and
my mind righted itself I hardly know how: not
certainly by religious influences&mdash;they passed over
my mind, and did not at the time sink into it,&mdash;and
as for earthly counsel or comfort, I never had either
when most needed. And as it fared with me then,
so it has been in after life; so it has been, <i>must</i> be,
with all those who, in fighting out alone the pitched
battle between principle and passion, will accept no
intervention between the infinite within them and
the infinite above them; so it has been, <i>must</i> be, with
all strong natures. Will it be said that victory in
the struggle brings increase of strength? It may
be so with some who survive the contest; but then,
how many sink! how many are crippled morally
for life! how many, strengthened in some particular
faculties, suffer in losing the harmony of the character
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
as a whole! This is one of the points in which the
matured mind may help the childish nature at strife
with itself. It is impossible to say how far this sort
of vindictiveness might have penetrated and hardened
into the character, if I had been of a timid or retiring
nature. It was expelled at last by no outer
influences, but by a growing sense of power and self-reliance.</p>

<p class="tb">In regard to truth&mdash;always such a difficulty in
education,&mdash;I certainly had, as a child, and like
most children, confused ideas about it. I had a more
distinct and absolute idea of honour than of truth,&mdash;a
mistake into which our conventional morality
leads those who educate and those who are educated.
I knew very well, in a general way, that to tell a lie
was <i>wicked</i>; to lie for my own profit or pleasure, or
to the hurt of others, was, according to my infant
code of morals, worse than wicked&mdash;it was <i>dishonourable</i>.
But I had no compunction about
telling <i>fictions</i>;&mdash;inventing scenes and circumstances,
which I related as real, and with a keen
sense of triumphant enjoyment in seeing the listener
taken in by a most artful and ingenious concatenation
of impossibilities. In this respect &#8220;Ferdinand
Mendez Pinto, that liar of the first magnitude,&#8221; was
nothing in comparison to me. I must have been
twelve years old before my conscience was first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
awakened up to a sense of the necessity of truth as a
principle, as well as its holiness as a virtue. Afterwards,
having to set right the minds of others cleared
my own mind on this and some other important
points.</p>

<p class="tb">I do not think I was naturally obstinate, but remember
going without food all day, and being sent
hungry and exhausted to bed, because I would not
do some trifling thing required of me. I think it
was to recite some lines I knew by heart. I was
punished as wilfully obstinate: but what no one
knew then, and what I know now as the fact, was,
that after refusing to do what was required, and
bearing anger and threats in consequence, I lost the
power to do it. I became stone: the <i>will</i> was petrified,
and I absolutely <i>could</i> not comply. They might
have hacked me in pieces before my lips could have
unclosed to utterance. The obstinacy was not in
the mind, but on the nerves; and I am persuaded
that what we call obstinacy in children, and grownup
people, too, is often something of this kind, and
that it may be increased, by mismanagement, by
persistence, or what is called firmness, in the controlling
power, into disease, or something near to it.</p>

<p class="tb">There was in my childish mind another cause of
suffering besides those I have mentioned, less acute,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
but more permanent and always unacknowledged.
It was fear&mdash;fear of darkness and supernatural influences.
As long as I can remember anything, I
remember these horrors of my infancy. How they
had been awakened I do not know; they were never
revealed. I had heard other children ridiculed for
such fears, and held my peace. At first these
haunting, thrilling, stifling terrors were vague; afterwards
the form varied; but one of the most permanent
was the ghost in Hamlet. There was a volume
of Shakspeare lying about, in which was an engraving
I have not seen since, but it remains distinct
in my mind as a picture. On one side stood
Hamlet with his hair on end, literally &#8220;like quills
upon the fretful porcupine,&#8221; and one hand with all
the fingers outspread. On the other strided the
ghost, encased in armour with nodding plumes; one
finger pointing forwards, and all surrounded with a
supernatural light. O that spectre! for three years
it followed me up and down the dark staircase, or
stood by my bed: only the blessed light had power
to exorcise it. How it was that I knew, while I
trembled and quaked, that it was unreal, never cried
out, never expostulated, never confessed, I do not
know. The figure of Apollyon looming over Christian,
which I had found in an old edition of the &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress,&#8221; was also a great torment. But worse,
perhaps, were certain phantasms without shape,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
things like the vision in Job&mdash;&#8220;<i>A spirit passed before
my face; it stood still, but I could not discern the
form thereof</i>:&#8221;&mdash;and if not intelligible voices, there
were strange unaccountable sounds filling the air
around with a sort of mysterious life. In daylight
I was not only fearless, but audacious, inclined to
defy all power and brave all danger,&mdash;that is, all
danger I could see. I remember volunteering to
lead the way through a herd of cattle (among which
was a dangerous bull, the terror of the neighbourhood)
armed only with a little stick; but first I said
the Lord&#8217;s Prayer fervently. In the ghastly night
I never prayed; terror stifled prayer. These visionary
sufferings, in some form or other, pursued me
till I was nearly twelve years old. If I had not
possessed a strong constitution and a strong understanding,
which rejected and contemned my own
fears, even while they shook me, I had been destroyed.
How much weaker children suffer in this way, I have
since known; and have known how to bring them
help and strength, through sympathy and knowledge,
the sympathy that soothes and does not encourage&mdash;the
knowledge that dispels, and does not suggest,
the evil.</p>

<p class="tb">People, in general, even those who have been
much interested in education, are not aware of the
sacred duty of <i>truth</i>, exact truth in their intercourse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
with children. Limit what you tell them according
to the measure of their faculties; but let what you
say be the truth. Accuracy not merely as to fact,
but well-considered accuracy in the use of words, is
essential with children. I have read some wise book
on the treatment of the insane, in which absolute
veracity and accuracy in speaking is prescribed
as a <i>curative</i> principle; and deception for any purpose
is deprecated as almost fatal to the health
of the patient. Now, it is a good sanatory principle,
that what is curative is preventive; and
that an unhealthy state of mind, leading to madness,
may, in some organisations, be induced by that sort
of uncertainty and perplexity which grows up where
the mind has not been accustomed to truth in its
external relations. It is like breathing for a continuance
an impure or confined air.</p>

<p>Of the mischief that may be done to a childish mind
by a falsehood uttered in thoughtless gaiety, I remember
an absurd and yet a painful instance. A
visitor was turning over, for a little girl, some prints,
one of which represented an Indian widow springing
into the fire kindled for the funeral pile of her husband.
It was thus explained to the child, who
asked innocently, whether, if her father died, her
mother would be burned? The person to whom
the question was addressed, a lively, amiable woman,
was probably much amused by the question, and an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>swered,
giddily, &#8220;Oh, of course,&mdash;certainly!&#8221; and
was believed implicitly. But thenceforth, for many
weary months, the mind of that child was haunted
and tortured by the image of her mother springing
into the devouring flames, and consumed by fire, with
all the accessories of the picture, particularly the
drums beating to drown her cries. In a weaker organisation,
the results might have been permanent
and serious. But to proceed.</p>

<p>These terrors I have described had an existence
external to myself: I had no power over them
to shape them by my will, and their power over
me vanished gradually before a more dangerous
infatuation,&mdash;the propensity to reverie. This
shaping spirit of imagination began when I was
about eight or nine years old to haunt my <i>inner</i>
life. I can truly say that, from ten years old to
fourteen or fifteen, I lived a double existence; one
outward, linking me with the external sensible world,
the other inward, creating a world to and for itself,
conscious to itself only. I carried on for whole
years a series of actions, scenes, and adventures;
one springing out of another, and coloured and modified
by increasing knowledge. This habit grew so
upon me, that there were moments&mdash;as when I came
to some crisis in my imaginary adventures,&mdash;when I
was not more awake to outward things than in sleep,&mdash;scarcely
took cognisance of the beings around me.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
When punished for idleness by being placed in solitary
confinement (the worst of all punishments for
children), the intended penance was nothing less than
a delight and an emancipation, giving me up to my
dreams. I had a very strict and very accomplished
governess, one of the cleverest women I have ever
met with in my life; but nothing of this was known
or even suspected by her, and I exulted in possessing
something which her power could not reach. My
reveries were my real life: it was an unhealthy state
of things.</p>

<p>Those who are engaged in the training of children
will perhaps pause here. It may be said, in the first
place, How are we to reach those recesses of the
inner life which the God who made us keeps from
every eye but his own? As when we walk over
the field in spring we are aware of a thousand
influences and processes at work of which we
have no exact knowledge or clear perception, yet
must watch and use accordingly,&mdash;so it is with
education. And secondly, it may be asked, if
such secret processes be working unconscious mischief,
where the remedy? The remedy is in employment.
Then the mother or the teacher echoes
with astonishment, &#8220;Employment! the child is employed
from morning till night; she is learning a
dozen sciences and languages; she has masters and
lessons for every hour of every day: with her pencil,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
her piano, her books, her companions, her birds, her
flowers,&mdash;what can she want more?&#8221; An energetic
child even at a very early age, and yet farther as the
physical organisation is developed, wants something
more and something better; employment which
shall bring with it the bond of a higher duty than
that which centres in self and self-improvement;
employment which shall not merely cultivate the
understanding, but strengthen and elevate the conscience;
employment for the higher and more generous
faculties; employment addressed to the sympathies;
employment which has the aim of utility, not
pretended, but real, obvious, direct utility. A girl
who as a mere child is not always being taught or
being amused, whose mind is early restrained by the
bond of definite duty, and thrown out of the limit of
self, will not in after years be subject to fancies that
disturb or to reveries that absorb, and the present
and the actual will have that power they ought to
have as combined in due degree with desire and
anticipation.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic priesthood understand this
well: employment, which enlists with the spiritual
the sympathetic part of our being, is a means through
which they guide both young and adult minds.
Physicians who have to manage various states of
mental and moral disease understand this well; they
speak of the necessity of employment (not mere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
amusement) as a curative means, but of employment
with the direct aim of usefulness, apprehended
and appreciated by the patient, else it is nothing.
It is the same with children. Such employment,
chosen with reference to utility, and in harmony
with the faculties, would prove in many cases either
preventive or curative. In my own case, as I now
think, it would have been both.</p>

<p>There was a time when it was thought essential
that women should know something of cookery,
something of medicine, something of surgery. If
all these things are far better understood now than
heretofore, is that a reason why a well educated
woman should be left wholly ignorant of them? A
knowledge of what people call &#8220;common things&#8221;&mdash;of
the elements of physiology, of the conditions of
health, of the qualities, nutritive or remedial, of substances
commonly used as food or medicine, and the
most economical and most beneficial way of applying
both,&mdash;these should form a part of the system of
every girls&#8217; school&mdash;whether for the higher or the
lower classes. At present you shall see a girl studying
chemistry, and attending Faraday&#8217;s lectures, who
would be puzzled to compound a rice-pudding or a
cup of barley-water: and a girl who could work
quickly a complicated sum in the Rule of Three,
afterwards wasting a fourth of her husband&#8217;s wages
through want of management.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>In my own case, how much of the practical and
the sympathetic in my nature was exhausted in airy
visions!</p>

<p>As to the stuff out of which my waking dreams
were composed, I cannot tell you much. I have a
remembrance that I was always a princess-heroine
in the disguise of a knight, a sort of Clorinda or
Britomart, going about to redress the wrongs of the
poor, fight giants, and kill dragons; or founding a
society in some far-off solitude or desolate island,
which would have rivalled that of Gonsalez, where
there were to be no tears, no tasks, and no laws,&mdash;except
those which I made myself,&mdash;no caged
birds nor tormented kittens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><img src="images/illus-039-2.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="145" width="300" /></div>

<p>Enough of the pains, and mistakes, and vagaries
of childhood; let me tell of some of its pleasures
equally unguessed and unexpressed. A great, and
exquisite source of enjoyment arose out of an early,
instinctive, boundless delight in external beauty.
How this went hand in hand with my terrors and
reveries, how it could coexist with them, I cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
tell now&mdash;it was so; and if this sympathy with the
external, living, beautiful world, had been properly,
scientifically cultivated, and directed to useful definite
purposes, it would have been the best remedy
for much that was morbid: this was not the case,
and we were, unhappily for me, too early removed
from the country to a town residence. I can remember,
however, that in very early years the appearances
of nature did truly &#8220;haunt me like a
passion;&#8221; the stars were to me as the gates of heaven;
the rolling of the wave to the shore, the graceful
weeds and grasses bending before the breeze as they
grew by the wayside; the minute and delicate forms
of insects; the trembling shadows of boughs and
leaves dancing on the ground in the highest noon;
these were to me perfect pleasures of which the
imagery now in my mind is distinct. Wordsworth&#8217;s
poem of &#8220;The Daffodils,&#8221; the one beginning&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;I wandered lonely as a cloud,&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>may appear to some unintelligible or overcharged,
but to me it was a vivid truth, a simple fact; and if
Wordsworth had been then in my hands I think I
must have loved him. It was this intense sense of
beauty which gave the first zest to poetry: I love
it, not because it told me what I did not know, but
because it helped me to words in which to clothe my
own knowledge and perceptions, and reflected back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the pictures unconsciously hoarded up in my mind.
This was what made Thomson&#8217;s &#8220;Seasons&#8221; a favourite
book when I first began to read for my own amusement,
and before I could understand one half of it;
St. Pierre&#8217;s &#8220;Indian Cottage&#8221; (&#8220;La Chaumi&egrave;re Indienne&#8221;)
was also charming, either because it reflected
my dreams, or gave me new stuff for them in
pictures of an external world quite different from
that I inhabited,&mdash;palm-trees, elephants, tigers,
dark-turbaned men with flowing draperies; and the
&#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221; completed my Oriental intoxication,
which lasted for a long time.</p>

<p>I have said little of the impressions left by
books, and of my first religious notions. A friend
of mine had once the wise idea of collecting together
a variety of evidence as to the impressions left by
certain books on childish or immature minds: If
carried out, it would have been one of the most
valuable additions to educational experience ever
made. For myself I did not much care about the
books put into my hands, nor imbibe much information
from them. I had a great taste, I am sorry to
say, for forbidden books; yet it was not the forbidden
books that did the mischief, except in their being
read furtively. I remember impressions of vice
and cruelty from some parts of the Old Testament
and Goldsmith&#8217;s &#8220;History of England,&#8221; which I
shudder to recall. Shakspeare was on the forbidden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
shelf. I had read him all through between seven
and ten years old. He never did me any moral
mischief. He never soiled my mind with any disordered
image. What was exceptionable and coarse
in language I passed by without attaching any meaning
whatever to it. How it might have been if
I had read Shakspeare first when I was fifteen
or sixteen, I do not know; perhaps the occasional
coarsenesses and obscurities might have shocked the
delicacy or puzzled the intelligence of that sensitive
and inquiring age. But at nine or ten I had
no comprehension of what was unseemly; what might
be obscure in words to wordy commentators, was to
me lighted up by the idea I found or interpreted for
myself&mdash;right or wrong.</p>

<p>No; I repeat, Shakspeare&mdash;bless him!&mdash;never
did me any moral mischief. Though the Witches in
Macbeth troubled me,&mdash;though the Ghost in Hamlet
terrified me (the picture that is,&mdash;for the spirit in
Shakspeare was solemn and pathetic, not hideous),&mdash;though
poor little Arthur cost me an ocean of
tears,&mdash;yet much that was obscure, and all that was
painful and revolting was merged on the whole in
the vivid presence of a new, beautiful, vigorous, living
world. The plays which I now think the most
wonderful produced comparatively little effect on my
fancy: Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Macbeth, struck
me then less than the historical plays, and far less
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
than the Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream and Cymbeline.
It may be thought, perhaps, that Falstaff is not a
character to strike a child, or to be understood by
a child:&mdash;no; surely not. To me Falstaff was not
witty and wicked&mdash;only irresistibly fat and funny;
and I remember lying on the ground rolling with
laughter over some of the scenes in Henry the
Fourth,&mdash;the mock play, and the seven men in
buckram. But The Tempest and Cymbeline were
the plays I liked best and knew best.</p>

<p>Altogether I should say that in my early years
books were known to me, not as such, not for their
general contents, but for some especial image or
picture I had picked out of them and assimilated to
my own mind and mixed up with my own life. For
example out of Homer&#8217;s Odyssey (lent to me by
the parish clerk) I had the picture of Nasicaa and
her maidens going down in their chariots to wash
their linen: so that when the first time I went
to the Pitti Palace, and could hardly see the
pictures through blinding tears, I saw <i>that</i> picture
of Rubens, which all remember who have been at
Florence, and it flashed delight and refreshment
through those remembered childish associations.
The Syrens and Polypheme left also vivid pictures
on my fancy. The Iliad, on the contrary,
wearied me, except the parting of Hector and Andromache,
in which the child, scared by its father&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
dazzling helm and nodding crest, remains a vivid
image in my mind from that time.</p>

<p>The same parish clerk&mdash;a curious fellow in his
way&mdash;lent me also some religious tracts and stories,
by Hannah More. It is most certain that more
moral mischief was done to me by some of these
than by all Shakspeare&#8217;s plays together. These so-called
pious tracts first introduced me to a knowledge
of the vices of vulgar life, and the excitements of a
vulgar religion,&mdash;the fear of being hanged and the
fear of hell became co-existent in my mind; and
the teaching resolved itself into this,&mdash;that it was
not by being naughty, but by being found out, that
I was to incur the risk of both. My fairy world
was better!</p>

<p>About Religion:&mdash;I was taught religion as children
used to be taught it in my younger days, and
are taught it still in some cases, I believe&mdash;through
the medium of creeds and catechisms. I read the
Bible too early, and too indiscriminately, and too
irreverently. Even the New Testament was too
early placed in my hands; too early made a lesson
book, as the custom then was. The <i>letter</i> of the
Scriptures&mdash;the words&mdash;were familiarised to me by
sermonising and dogmatising, long before I could
enter into the <i>spirit</i>. Meantime, happily, another
religion was growing up in my heart, which,
strangely enough, seemed to me quite apart from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
that which was taught,&mdash;which, indeed, I never in
any way regarded as the same which I was taught
when I stood up wearily on a Sunday to repeat the
collect and say the catechism. It was quite another
thing. Not only the taught religion and the sentiment
of faith and adoration were never combined,
but it never for years entered into my head to combine
them; the first remained extraneous, the latter
had gradually taken root in my life, even from the
moment my mother joined my little hands in prayer.
The histories out of the Bible (the Parables especially)
were, however, enchanting to me, though my
interpretation of them was in some instances the
very reverse of correct or orthodox. To my infant
conception our Lord was a being who had come
down from heaven to make people good, and to tell
them beautiful stories. And though no pains were
spared to <i>indoctrinate</i> me, and all my pastors and
masters took it for granted that my ideas were quite
satisfactory, nothing could be more confused and
heterodox.</p>

<p class="tb">It is a common observation that girls of lively
talents are apt to grow pert and satirical. I fell
into this danger when about ten years old. Sallies
at the expense of certain people, ill-looking, or ill-dressed,
or ridiculous, or foolish, had been laughed
at and applauded in company, until, without being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
naturally malignant, I ran some risk of becoming so
from sheer vanity.</p>

<p>The fables which appeal to our higher moral sympathies
may sometimes do as much for us as the
truths of science. So thought our Saviour when he
taught the multitude in parables.</p>

<p>A good clergyman who lived near us, a famous
Persian scholar, took it into his head to teach me
Persian (I was then about seven years old), and I
set to work with infinite delight and earnestness.
All I learned was soon forgotten; but a few years
afterwards, happening to stumble on a volume of
Sir William Jones&#8217;s works&mdash;his Persian grammar&mdash;it
revived my Orientalism, and I began to study it
eagerly. Among the exercises given was a Persian
fable or poem&mdash;one of those traditions of our Lord
which are preserved in the East. The beautiful
apologue of &#8220;St. Peter and the Cherries,&#8221; which
Goethe has versified or imitated, is a well known
example. This fable I allude to was something
similar, but I have not met with the original these
forty years, and must give it here from memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus,&#8221; says the story, &#8220;arrived one evening at
the gates of a certain city, and he sent his disciples
forward to prepare supper, while he himself, intent
on doing good, walked through the streets into the
market place.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he saw at the corner of the market some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
people gathered together looking at an object on the
ground; and he drew near to see what it might be.
It was a dead dog, with a halter round his neck,
by which he appeared to have been dragged through
the dirt; and a viler, a more abject, a more unclean
thing, never met the eyes of man.</p>

<p>&#8220;And those who stood by looked on with abhorrence.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Faugh!&#8217; said one, stopping his nose; &#8216;it pollutes
the air.&#8217; &#8216;How long,&#8217; said another, &#8216;shall this
foul beast offend our sight?&#8217; &#8216;Look at his torn
hide,&#8217; said a third; &#8216;one could not even cut a shoe
out of it.&#8217; &#8216;And his ears,&#8217; said a fourth, &#8216;all draggled
and bleeding!&#8217; &#8216;No doubt,&#8217; said a fifth, &#8216;he
hath been hanged for thieving!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Jesus heard them, and looking down compassionately
on the dead creature, he said, &#8216;Pearls
are not equal to the whiteness of his teeth!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the people turned towards him with
amazement, and said among themselves, &#8216;Who is
this? this must be Jesus of Nazareth, for only <span class="smcap">He</span>
could find something to pity and approve even in a
dead dog;&#8217; and being ashamed, they bowed their
heads before him, and went each on his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>I can recall, at this hour, the vivid, yet softening
and pathetic impression left on my fancy by this old
Eastern story. It struck me as exquisitely humorous,
as well as exquisitely beautiful. It gave me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
a pain in my conscience, for it seemed thenceforward
so easy and so vulgar to say satirical things, and so
much nobler to be benign and merciful, and I took
the lesson so home, that I was in great danger of
falling into the opposite extreme,&mdash;of seeking the
beautiful even in the midst of the corrupt and the
repulsive. Pity, a large element in my composition,
might have easily degenerated into weakness,
threatening to subvert hatred of evil in trying to
find excuses for it; and whether my mind has ever
completely righted itself, I am not sure.</p>

<p class="tb">Educators are not always aware, I think, how acute
are the perceptions, and how permanent the memories,
of children. I remember experiments tried upon
my temper and feelings, and how I was made aware
of this, by their being repeated, and, in some instances,
spoken of, before me. Music, to which I
was early and peculiarly sensitive, was sometimes
made the medium of these experiments. Discordant
sounds were not only hateful, but made me turn
white and cold, and sent the blood backward to my
heart; and certain tunes had a curious effect, I
cannot now account for: for though, when heard
for the first time, they had little effect, they became
intolerable by repetition; they turned up some
hidden emotion within me too strong to be borne. It
could not have been from association, which I believe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
to be a principal element in the <i>emotion</i> excited by
music. I was too young for that. What associations
could such a baby have had with pleasure or with
pain? Or could it be possible that associations with
some former state of existence awoke up to sound?
That our life &#8220;hath elsewhere its beginning, and
cometh from afar,&#8221; is a belief or at least an instinct,
in some minds, which music, and only music, seems
to thrill into consciousness. At this time, when I was
about five or six years old, Mrs. Arkwright&mdash;she was
then Fanny Kemble&mdash;used to come to our house,
and used to entrance me with her singing. I had a
sort of adoration for her, such as an ecstatic votary
might have for a Saint Cecilia. I trembled with
pleasure when I only heard her step. But her
voice!&mdash;it has charmed hundreds since; whom has
it ever moved to a more genuine passion of delight
than the little child that crept silent and tremulous
to her side? And she was fond of me,&mdash;fond of
singing to me, and, it must be confessed, fond also
of playing these experiments on me. The music of
&#8220;Paul and Virginia&#8221; was then in vogue, and there
was one air&mdash;a very simple air&mdash;in that opera,
which, after the first few bars, always made me stop
my ears and rush out of the room. I became at last
aware that this was sometimes done by particular
desire to please my parents, or amuse and interest
others by the display of such vehement emotion.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
My infant conscience became perplexed between the
reality of the feeling and the exhibition of it. People
are not always aware of the injury done to children
by repeating before them things they say, or describing
things they do: words and actions, spontaneous
and unconscious, become thenceforth artificial
and conscious. I can speak of the injury done
to myself, between five and eight years old. There
was some danger of my becoming a precocious actress,&mdash;danger
of permanent mischief such as I have seen
done to other children,&mdash;but I was saved by the
recoil of resistance and resentment excited in my
mind.</p>

<p>This is enough. All that has been told here
refers to a period between five and ten years old.</p>

<h4>THE INDIAN HUNTER AND THE FIRE.</h4>

<h5>(FROM THE GERMAN.)</h5>

<p>Once upon a time the lightning from heaven fell
upon a tree standing in the old primeval forest and
kindled it, so that it flamed on high. And it happened
that a young hunter, who had lost his path in that
wilderness, beheld the gleam of the flames from a
distance, and, forcing his way through the thicket, he
flung himself down in rapture before the blazing tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;O divine light and warmth!&#8221; he exclaimed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
stretching forth his arms. &#8220;O blessed! O heaven-descended
Fire! let me thank thee! let me adore
thee! Giver of a new existence, quickening thro&#8217;
every pulse, how lost, how cold, how dark have I
dwelt without thee! Restorer of my life! remain
ever near me, and, through thy benign and celestial
influence, send love and joy to illuminate my soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Fire answered and said to him, &#8220;It is true
that my birth is from heaven, but I am now, through
mingling with earthly elements, subdued to earthly
influences; therefore, beware how you choose me
for thy friend, without having first studied my twofold
nature. O youth! take heed lest what appear to
thee now a blessing, may be turned, at some future
time, to fiery pain and death.&#8221; And the youth replied,
&#8220;No! O no! thou blessed Fire, this could
never be. Am I then so senseless, so inconstant, so
thankless? O believe it not! Let me stay near thee;
let me be thy priest, to watch and tend thee truly.
Ofttimes in my wild wintry life, when the chill darkness
encompassed me, and the ice-blast lifted my hair,
have I dreamed of the soft summer breath,&mdash;of the
sunshine that should light up the world within me and
the world around me. But still that time came not.
It seemed ever far, far off; and I had perished utterly
before the light and the warmth had reached me, had
it not been for thee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the youth poured forth his soul, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Fire answered him in murmured tones, while her
beams with a softer radiance played over his cheek
and brow: &#8220;Be it so then. Yet do thou watch
me constantly and minister to me carefully; neglect
me not, leave me not to myself, lest the light and
warmth in which thou so delightest fail thee suddenly,
and there be no redress; and O watch thyself
also! beware lest thou too ardently stir up my
impatient fiery being! beware lest thou heap too
much fuel upon me; once more beware, lest, instead
of life, and love, and joy, I bring thee only death
and burning pain!&#8221; And the youth passionately
vowed to keep her behest: and in the beginning all
went well. How often, for hours together, would
he lie gazing entranced toward the radiant beneficent
Fire, basking in her warmth, and throwing now a
leafy spray, now a fragment of dry wood, anon a
handful of odorous gums, as incense, upon the flame,
which gracefully curling and waving upwards, quivering
and sparkling, seemed to whisper in return divine
oracles; or he fancied he beheld, while gazing into
the glowing depths, marvellous shapes, fairy visions
dancing and glancing along. Then he would sing to
her songs full of love, and she, responding to the
song she had herself inspired, sometimes replied, in
softest whispers, so loving and so low, that even the
jealous listening woods could not overhear; at other
times she would shoot up suddenly in rapturous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
splendour, like a pillar of light, and revealed to him
all the wonders and the beauties which lay around
him, hitherto veiled from his sight.</p>

<p>But at length, as he became accustomed to the
glory and the warmth, and nothing more was left for
the fire to bestow, or her light to reveal, then he
began to weary and to dream again of the morning,
and to long for the sun-beams; and it was to him as
if the fire stood between him and the sun&#8217;s light, and
he reproached her therefore, and he became moody
and ungrateful; and the fire was no longer the same,
but unquiet and changeful, sometimes flickering unsteadily,
sometimes throwing out a lurid glare. And
when the youth, forgetful of his ministry, left the
flame unfed and unsustained, so that ofttimes she
drooped and waned, and crept in dying gleams along
the damp ground, his heart would fail him with a
sudden remorse, and he would cast on the fuel with
such a rough and lavish hand that the indignant fire
hissed thereat, and burst forth in a smoky sullen
gleam,&mdash;then died away again. Then the youth,
half sorrowful, half impatient, would remember how
bright, how glowing, how dazzling was the flame in
those former happy days, when it played over his
chilled and wearied limbs, and shed its warmth upon
his brow, and he desired eagerly to recall that once
inspiring glow. And he stirred up the embers violently
till they burned him, and then he grew angry,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
and then again he wearied of all the watching and
the care which the subtle, celestial, tameless element
required at his hand: and at length, one day in a
sullen mood, he snatched up a pitcher of water from
the fountain and poured it hastily on the yet living
flame.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>For one moment it arose blazing towards heaven,
shed a last gleam upon the pale brow of the youth,
and then sank down in darkness extinguished for
ever!</p>

<h3><span class="oldtype">Theological Fragments.</span></h3>

<h5>1.</h5>

<h4>THE HERMIT AND THE MINSTREL.</h4>

<h5>(A PARABLE, FROM ST. JEROME.)</h5>

<p>A certain holy anchorite had passed a long life in
a cave of the Thebaid, remote from all communion
with men; and eschewing, as he would the gates of
Hell, even the very presence of a woman; and he
fasted and prayed, and performed many and severe
penances; and his whole thought was how he should
make himself of account in the sight of God, that he
might enter into his paradise.</p>

<p>And having lived this life for three score and ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
years he was puffed up with the notion of his own
great virtue and sanctity, and, like to St. Anthony,
he besought the Lord to show him what saint he
should emulate as greater than himself, thinking
perhaps, in his heart, that the Lord would answer
that none was greater or holier. And the same
night the angel of God appeared to him, and said,
&#8220;If thou wouldst excel all others in virtue and
sanctity, thou must strive to be like a certain minstrel
who goes begging and singing from door to door.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the holy man was in great astonishment, and
he arose and took his staff and ran forth in search of
this minstrel; and when he had found him he questioned
him earnestly, saying, &#8220;Tell me, I pray thee,
my brother, what good works thou hast performed
in thy lifetime, and by what prayers and penances
thou hast made thyself acceptable to God?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the man, greatly wondering and ashamed to
be so questioned, hung down his head as he replied,
&#8220;I beseech thee, holy father, mock me not! I have
performed no good works, and as to praying, alas!
sinner that I am, I am not worthy to pray. I do
nothing but go about from door to door amusing the
people with my viol and my flute.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the holy man insisted and said, &#8220;Nay, but
peradventure in the midst of this thy evil life thou
hast done some good works?&#8221; And the minstrel
replied, &#8220;I know of nothing good that I have done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>&#8221;
And the hermit, wondering more and more, said,
&#8220;How hast thou become a beggar: hast thou spent
thy substance in riotous living, like most others of
thy calling?&#8221; and the man answering, said, &#8220;Nay;
but there was a poor woman whom I found running
hither and thither in distraction, for her husband and
her children had been sold into slavery to pay a debt.
And the woman being very fair, certain sons of
Belial pursued after her; so I took her home to my
hut and protected her from them, and I gave her all
I possessed to redeem her family, and conducted her
in safety to the city, where she was reunited to her
husband and children. But what of that, my father;
is there a man who would not have done the same?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the hermit, hearing the minstrel speak these
words, wept bitterly, saying, &#8220;For my part, I have
not done so much good in all my life; and yet they
call me a man of God, and thou art only a poor minstrel!&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">At Vienna, some years ago, I saw a picture by
Von Schwind, which was conceived in the spirit
of this old apologue. It exhibited the lives of two
twin brothers diverging from the cradle. One of
them, by profound study, becomes a most learned
and skilful physician, and ministers to the sick; attaining
to great riches and honours through his
labours and his philanthropy. The other brother,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
who has no turn for study, becomes a poor fiddler,
and spends his life in consoling, by his music, sufferings
beyond the reach of the healing art. In the
end, the two brothers meet at the close of life. He
who had been fiddling through the world is sick and
worn out: his brother prescribes for him, and is seen
culling simples for his restoration, while the fiddler
touches his instrument for the solace of his kind
physician.</p>

<p>It is in such representations that painting did once
speak, and might again speak to the hearts of the
people.</p>

<p>Another version of the same thought, we find in
De Berenger&#8217;s pretty ballad, &#8220;<i>Les deux S&oelig;urs de
Charit&eacute;</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h5>2.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> I was a child, and read Milton for the first
time, his Pandemonium seemed to me a magnificent
place. It struck me more than his Paradise,
for <i>that</i> was beautiful, but Pandemonium was terrible
and beautiful too. The wondrous fabric that &#8220;from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the earth rose like an exhalation to the sound of
dulcet symphonies and voices sweet,&#8221;&mdash;the splendid
piles of architecture sweeping line beyond line,
&#8220;Cornice and frieze with bossy sculptures graven,&#8221;&mdash;realised
a certain picture of Palmyra I had once
seen, and which had taken possession of my imagination:
then the throne, outshining the wealth of Ormuz
and of Ind,&mdash;the flood of light streaming from &#8220;starry
lamps and blazing cressets&#8221; quite threw the flames of
perdition into the shade. As it was said of Erskine,
that he always spoke of Satan with respect, as of a
great statesman out of place, a sort of leader of the
Opposition; so to me the grand arch-fiend was a hero,
like my <i>then</i> favourite Greeks and Romans, a Cymon,
a Curtius, a Decius, devoting himself for the good of
his country;&mdash;such was the moral confusion created
in my mind. Pandemonium inspired no horror; on
the contrary, my fancy revelled in the artistic
beauty of the creation. I felt that I should like to
go and see it; so that, in fact, if Milton meant to
inspire abhorrence, he has failed, even to the height
of his sublimity. Dante has succeeded better.
Those who dwell with complacency on the doctrine
of eternal punishments must delight in the ferocity
and the ingenuity of his grim inventions, worthy of
a vengeful theology. Wicked latitudinarians may
shudder and shiver at the images called up&mdash;grotesque,
abominable, hideous&mdash;but then Dante him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>self
would sternly rebuke them for making their
human sympathies a measure for the judgments of
God, and compassion only a veil for treason and
rebellion:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>However, it must be said in favour of Dante&#8217;s
Inferno, that no one ever wished to go there.</p>

<p>These be the Christian poets! but they must
yield in depth of imagined horrors to the Christian
Fathers. Tertullian (writing in the second century)
not only sends the wicked into that dolorous region
of despair, but makes the endless measureless torture
of the doomed a part of the joys of the redeemed.
The spectacle is to give them the same sort of
delight as the heathen took in their games, and
Pandemonium is to be as a vast amphitheatre for the
amusement of the New Jerusalem. &#8220;How magnificent,&#8221;
exclaims this pious doctor of the Church,
&#8220;will be the scale of that game! With what
admiration, what laughter, what glee, what triumph,
shall I behold so many mighty monarchs, who had
been given out as received into the skies, moaning in
unfathomable gloom! Persecutors of the Christians
liquefying amid shooting spires of flame! Philosophers
blushing before their disciples amid those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
ruddy fires! Then,&#8221; he goes on, still alluding to the
amphitheatre, &#8220;then is the time to hear the tragedians
doubly pathetic, now that they bewail their own
agonies! To observe actors released by the fierceness
of their torments from all restraints on their
gestures! Then may we admire the charioteer
glowing all over in his car of torture, and watch the
wrestlers struggling, not in the gymnasium but with
flames!&#8221; And he asks exultingly, &#8220;What pr&aelig;tor,
or consul, or questor, or priest, can purchase you by
his munificence a game of triumph like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>And even more terrible are the imaginations of
good Bishop Taylor, who distils the essence from all
sins, all miseries, all sorrows, all terrors, all plagues,
and mingles them in one chalice of wrath and
vengeance to be held to the lips and forced down
the unwilling throats of the doomed &#8220;with violence
of devils and accursed spirits!&#8221; Are these mere
words? Did any one ever fancy or try to realise
what they express?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">was</span> surprised to find this passage in one of
Southey&#8217;s letters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tb">&#8220;A Catholic Establishment would be the best,
perhaps the only means of civilising Ireland. Jesuits
and Benedictines, though they would not enlighten
the savages, would humanise them and bring the
country into cultivation. A petition that asked for
this, saying plainly, &#8216;We are Papists, and will be so,
and this is the best thing that can be done for us and
you too,&#8217;&mdash;such a petition I would support, considering
what the present condition of Ireland is, how
wretchedly it has always been governed, and how
hopeless the prospect.&#8221; (1805.)</p>

<p class="tb">Southey was thinking of what the religious orders
had done for Paraguay; whether he would have
penned the same sentiments twenty or even ten
years later, is more than doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> old monks and penitents&mdash;dirty, ugly, emaciated
old fellows they were!&mdash;spent their days
in speaking and preaching of their own and others&#8217;

them a standard of beauty, brightness, beneficence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
aspirations which nothing earthly could satisfy,
which made their ideas of sinfulness and misery
<i>comparative</i>, and their scale was graduated from
themselves <i>upwards</i>. We philosophers reverse this.
We teach and preach the spiritual dignity, the lofty
capabilities of humanity. Yet, by some mistake, we
seem to be always speculating on the amount of evil
which may or can be endured, and on the amount of
wickedness which may or must be tolerated; and our
scale is graduated from ourselves <i>downwards</i>.</p>

<h5>5.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;S</span><span class="smcap">o</span> long as the ancient mythology had any separate
establishment in the empire, the spiritual
worship which our religion demands, and so essentially
implies as only fitting for it, was preserved in its
purity by means of the salutary contrast; but no
sooner had the Church become completely triumphant
and exclusive, and the parallel of Pagan
idolatry totally removed, than the old constitutional
appetite revived in all its original force, and after a
short but famous struggle with the Iconoclasts, an
image worship was established, and consecrated by
bulls and canons, which, in whatever light it is
regarded, differed in no respect but the names of its
objects from that which had existed for so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
ages as the chief characteristic of the religious faith
of the Gentiles.&#8221;&mdash;<i>H. Nelson Coleridge.</i></p>

<p>I think, with submission, that it differed in sentiment;
for in the mythology of the Pagans the worship
was to <i>beauty</i>, <i>immortality</i>, and <i>power</i>, and in
the Christian mythology&mdash;if I may call it so&mdash;of
the Middle Ages, the worship was to <i>purity</i>, <i>self-denial</i>,
and <i>charity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;A</span> <span class="smcap">narrow</span> half-enlightened reason may easily
make sport of all those forms in which religious
faith has been clothed by human imagination,
and ask why they are retained, and why one should
be preferred to another? It is sufficient to reply,
that some forms there must be if Religion is to endure
as a social influence, and that the forms already
in existence are the best, if they are in unison with
human sympathies, and express, with the breadth
and vagueness which every popular utterance must
from its nature possess, the interior convictions of
the general mind. What would become of the most
sacred truth if all the forms which have harboured it
were destroyed at once by an unrelenting reason,
and it were driven naked and shivering about the
earth till some clever logician had devised a suitable
abode for its reception? It is on these outward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
forms of religion that the spirit of artistic beauty
descends and moulds them into fitting expressions of
the invisible grace and majesty of spiritual truth.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Prospective
Review</i>, Feb. 24. 1845.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">remember</span> once at Merton College Chapel (May,
1844), while Archdeacon Manning was preaching
an eloquent sermon on the eternity of reward and
punishment in the future life, I was looking at the
row of windows opposite, and I saw that there were
seven, all different in pattern and construction, yet
all harmonising with each other and with the building
of which they formed a part;&mdash;a symbol they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
might have been of differences in the Church of
Christ. From the varied windows opposite I looked
down to the faces of the congregation, all upturned
to the preacher, with expression how different!
Faith, hope, fear, in the open mouths and expanded
eyelids of some; a sort of silent protest in the compressed
lips and knitted brows of others; a speculative
inquiry and interest, or merely admiring acquiescence
in others; as the high or low, the wide or
contracted head prevailed; and all this diversity in
organisation, in habits of thought, in expression, harmonised
for the time by one predominant object, one
feeling! the hungry sheep looking up to be fed!
When I sigh over apparent disagreement, let me
think of those windows in Merton College Chapel,
and the same light from heaven streaming through
them all!&mdash;and of that assemblage of human faces,
uplifted with the same aspiration one and all!</p>

<h5>9.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">have</span> just read the article (by Sterling, I believe),
in the &#8220;Edinburgh Review&#8221; for July; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
as it chanced, this same evening, Dr. Channing&#8217;s
&#8220;Discourse on the Church,&#8221; and Captain Maconochie&#8217;s
&#8220;Report on Secondary Punishments&#8221; from
Sydney, came before me.</p>

<p>And as I laid them down, one after another, <i>this</i>
thought struck me:&mdash;that about the same time, in
three different and far divided regions of the globe,
three men, one military, the other an ecclesiastic, the
third a lawyer, and belonging apparently to different
religious denominations, all gave utterance to nearly
the same sentiments in regard to a Christian Church.
Channing says, &#8220;A church destined to endure
through all ages, to act on all, to blend itself with
new forms of society, and with the highest improvements
of the race, cannot be expected to ordain an
immutable mode of administration, but must leave its
modes of worship and communion to conform themselves
silently and gradually to the wants and progress
of humanity. The rites and arrangements
which suit one period lose their significance or efficiency
in another; the forms which minister to the
mind <i>now</i> may fetter it hereafter, and must give
place to its free unfolding,&#8221; &amp;c., and more to the
same purpose.</p>

<p>The reviewer says, &#8220;We believe that in the
judgment of an enlightened charity, many Christian
societies who are accustomed to denounce each others&#8217;
errors, will at length come to be regarded as members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
in common of one great and comprehensive Church,
in which diversity of forms are harmonised by an all-pervading
unity of spirit.&#8221; And more to the same
purpose. The soldier and reformer says, &#8220;I believe
there may be error because there must be imperfection
in the religious faith of the best among us;
but that the degree of this error is not vital in any
Christian denomination seems demonstrable by the
best fruits of faith&mdash;good works&mdash;being evidenced
by all.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is pleasant to see benign spirits divided in
opinion, but harmonised by faith, thus standing hand
in hand upon a shore of peace, and looking out together
in serene hope for the dawning of a better
day, instead of rushing forth, each with his own
farthing candle, under pretence of illuminating the
world&mdash;every one even more intent on putting out
his neighbour&#8217;s light than on guarding his own.</p>

<p class="name">(Nov. 15. 1841.)</p>

<p class="tb">While the idea of possible harmony in the universal
Church of Christ (by which I mean all who
accept His teaching and are glad to bear His name)
is gaining ground theoretically, <i>practically</i> it seems
more and more distant; since 1841 (when the above
was written) the divergence is greater than ever;
and, as in politics, moderate opinions appear (since
1848) to merge on either side into the extremes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
ultra conservatism and ultra radicalism, as fear of
the past or hope of the future predominate, so it is
in the Church. The sort of dualism which prevails
in politics and religion might give some colour to
Lord Lindsay&#8217;s theory of &#8220;progress through antagonism.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">incline</span> to agree with those who think it a great
mistake to consider the present conditions or
conception of Christianity as complete and final:
like the human soul to which it was fitted by Divine
love and wisdom, it has an immeasurable capacity of
development, and &#8220;The Lord hath more truth yet
to break forth out of his Holy Word.&#8221;</p>

with the Apostolic times, but for more; but
above all, they want their wounds healed by a
Christianity showing a life-renewing vitality allied
to reason and conscience, and ready and able to
reform the social relations of life, beginning with the
domestic and culminating with the political. They
want no negations, but positive reconstruction&mdash;no
conventionality, but an honest <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> foundation,
deep as the human mind, and a structure free and
organic as nature. In the meantime let no national
form be urged as identical with divine truth, let no
dogmatic formula oppress conscience and reason, and
let no corporation of priests, no set of dogmatists,
sow discord and hatred in the sacred communities of
domestic and national life. This view cannot be obtained
without national efforts, Christian education,

is truly a very material view of Christianity. If I

certain of the truth of Christianity as a system of

<h4>NOTES FROM VARIOUS SERMONS,</h4>

<h5>MADE ON THE SPOT;</h5>

<h5>SHOWING SOME THINGS IN WHICH ALL GOOD MEN ARE AGREED.</h5>

<h4>I.</h4>

<h4><i>From a Roman Catholic Sermon.</i></h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> travelling in Ireland, I stayed over one
Sunday in a certain town in the north, and
rambled out early in the morning. It was cold and
wet, the streets empty and quiet, but the sound of
voices drew me in one direction, down a court where
was a Roman Catholic chapel. It was so crowded
that many of the congregation stood round the door.
I remarked among them a number of soldiers and
most miserable-looking women. All made way for
me with true national courtesy, and I entered at the
moment the priest was finishing mass, and about to
begin his sermon. There was no pulpit, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
stood on the step of the altar; a fine-looking man,
with a bright face, a sonorous voice, and a <i>very</i>
strong Irish accent. His text was from Matt. v.
43, 44.</p>

<p>He began by explaining what Christ really meant
by the words &#8220;Love thy neighbour.&#8221; Then drew a
picture in contrast of hatred and dissension, commencing
with dissension in families, between kindred,
and between husband and wife. Then made a
most touching appeal in behalf of children brought
up in an atmosphere of contention where no love is.
&#8220;God help them! God pity them! small chance for
them of being either good or happy! for their young
hearts are saddened and soured with strife, and they
eat their bread in bitterness!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he preached patience to the wives, indulgence
to the husbands, and denounced scolds and
quarrelsome women in a manner that seemed to
glance at recent events: &#8220;When ye are found in the
streets vilifying and slandering one another, ay, and
fighting and tearing each other&#8217;s hair, do ye think
ye&#8217;re women? no, ye&#8217;re not! ye&#8217;re devils incarnate,
and ye&#8217;ll go where the devils will be fit companions
for ye!&#8221; &amp;c. (Here some women near me, with
long black hair streaming down, fell upon their
knees, sobbing with contrition.) He then went on,
in the same strain of homely eloquence, to the evils
of political and religious hatred, and quoted the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
text, &#8220;If it be possible, as much as lieth in you,
live peaceably with all men.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m a Catholic,&#8221; he
went on, &#8220;and I believe in the truth of my own
religion above all others. I&#8217;m convinced, by long
study and observation, it&#8217;s the best that is; but
what then? Do ye think I hate my neighbour because
he thinks differently? Do ye think I <i>mane</i> to
force my religion down other people&#8217;s throats? If I
were to preach such uncharity to ye, my people,
you wouldn&#8217;t listen to me, ye oughtn&#8217;t to listen to
me. Did Jesus Christ force His religion down other
people&#8217;s throats? Not He! He endured all, He was
kind to all, even to the wicked Jews that afterwards
crucified Him.&#8221; &#8220;If you say you can&#8217;t love your
neighbour because he&#8217;s your enemy, and has injured
you, what does that mane? &#8216;<i>ye can&#8217;t! ye can&#8217;t!</i>&#8217; as
if that excuse will serve God? hav&#8217;n&#8217;t ye done more
and worse against Him? and didn&#8217;t He send His
only Son into the world to redeem ye? My good
people, you&#8217;re all sprung from one stock, all sons of
Adam, all related to one another. When God
created Eve, mightn&#8217;t He have made her out of any
thing, a stock or a stone, or out of nothing at all,
at all? but He took one of Adam&#8217;s ribs and moulded
her out of that, and gave her to him, just to show
that we&#8217;re all from one original, all related together,
men and women, Catholics and Protestants, Jews
and Turks and Christians; all bone of one bone, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
flesh of one flesh!&#8221; He then insisted and demonstrated
that all the miseries of life, all the sorrows
and mistakes of men, women, and children; and, in
particular, all the disasters of Ireland, the bankrupt
landlords, the religious dissensions, the fights domestic
and political, the rich without thought for the
poor, and the poor without food or work, all arose
from nothing but the want of love. &#8220;Down on
your knees,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;and ask God&#8217;s mercy
and pardon; and as ye hope to find it, ask pardon
one of another for every angry word ye have spoken,
for every uncharitable thought that has come into
your minds; and if any man or woman have aught
against his neighbour, no matter what, let it be
plucked out of his heart before he laves this place,
let it be forgotten at the door of this chapel. Let
me, your pastor, have no more rason to be ashamed
of you; as if I were set over wild bastes, instead of
Christian men and women!&#8221;</p>

<p>After more in this fervid strain, which I cannot
recollect, he gave his blessing in the same earnest
heartfelt manner. I never saw a congregation more
attentive, more reverent, and apparently more touched
and edified. (1848.)</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<h4><i>From another Roman Catholic Sermon, delivered in
the private chapel of a Nobleman.</i></h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> Discourse was preached on the festival of
St. John the Baptist, and was a summary of his
doctrine, life, and character. The text was taken
from St. Luke, iii. 9. to 14.; in which St. John
answers the question of the people, &#8220;what shall we
do then?&#8221; by a brief exposition of their several
duties.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is most remarkable in all this,&#8221; said the
priest, &#8220;is truly that there is nothing very remarkable
in it. The Baptist required from his hearers
very simple and very familiar duties,&mdash;such as he
was not the first to preach, such as had been recognised
as duties by all religions; and do you think
that those who were neither Jews nor Christians
were therefore left without any religion? No! never
did God leave any of his creatures without religion;
they could not utter the words <i>right</i>, <i>wrong</i>,&mdash;<i>beautiful</i>,
<i>hateful</i>, without recognising a religion written
by God on their hearts from the beginning&mdash;a
religion which existed before the preaching of John,
before the coming of Christ, and of which the appearance
of John and the doctrine and sacrifice of Christ,
were but the fulfilment. For Christ came to <i>fulfil</i>
the law, not to destroy it. Do you ask what law?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Not the law of Moses, but the universal law of God&#8217;s
moral truth written in our hearts. It is, my friends,
a folly to talk of <i>natural</i> religion as of something
different from <i>revealed</i> religion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great proof of the truth of John&#8217;s mission
lies in its comprehensiveness: men and women, artisans
and soldiers, the rich and the poor, the young
and the old, gathered to him in the wilderness;
and he included all in his teaching, for he was
sent to all; and the best proof of the truth of his
teaching lies in its harmony with that law already
written in the heart and the conscience of men.
When Christ came afterwards, he preached a doctrine
more sublime, with a more authoritative voice; but
here, also, the best proof we have of the truth of
that divine teaching lies in this&mdash;that he had prepared
from the beginning the heart and the conscience
of man to harmonise with it.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">This was a very curious sermon; quiet, elegant,
and learned, with a good deal of sacred and profane
history introduced in illustration, which I am sorry
I cannot remember in detail. It made, however, no
appeal to feeling or to practice; and after listening
to it, we all went in to luncheon and discussed our
newspapers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/illus-024.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="87" width="350" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<h4><i>Fragments of a Sermon (Anglican Church).</i></h4>

<p>Text, Luke iv., from the 14th to the 18th, but more
especially the 18th verse. This sermon was extempore.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> preacher began by observing, that our Lord&#8217;s
sermon at Nazareth established the second of two
principles. By his sermon from the Mount, in which
he had addressed the multitude in the open air, under
the vault of the blue heaven alone, he has left to us
the principle that all places are fitted for the service
of God, and that all places may be sanctified by the
preaching of his truth. While, by his sermon in the
Synagogue (that which is recorded by St. Luke in
this passage), he has established the principle, that it
is right to set apart a place to assemble together in
worship and to listen to instruction; and it is observable
that on this occasion our Saviour taught in
the synagogue, where there was no sacrifice, no
ministry of the priests, as in the Temple; but where
a portion of the law and the prophets might be read
by any man; and any man, even a stranger (as he
was himself), might be called upon to expound.</p>

<p>Then reading impressively the whole of the narrative
down to the 32nd verse, the preacher closed
the sacred volume, and went on to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There are two orders of evil in the world&mdash;Sin
and Crime. Of the second, the world takes strict
cognisance; of the first, it takes comparatively little;
yet <i>that</i> is worse in the eyes of God. There are two
orders of temptation: the temptation which assails
our lower nature&mdash;our appetites; the temptation
which assails our higher nature&mdash;our intellect. The
<i>first</i>, leading to sin in the body, is punished in the
body,&mdash;the consequence being pain, disease, death.
The <i>second</i>, leading to sins of the soul, as pride
chiefly, uncharitableness, selfish sacrifice of others to
our own interests or purposes,&mdash;is punished in the
soul&mdash;in the <span class="smcap">Hell of the Spirit.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>(All this part of his discourse very beautiful,
earnest, eloquent; but I regretted that he did not
follow out the distinction he began with between <i>sin</i>
and <i>crime</i>, and the views and deductions, religious
and moral, which that distinction leads to.)</p>

<p>He continued to this effect: &#8220;Christ said that it
was a part of his mission to heal the broken-hearted.
What is meant by the phrase &#8216;a broken heart?&#8217;&#8221; He
illustrated it by the story of Eli, and by the wife of
Phineas, both of whom died broken in heart; &#8220;and
our Saviour himself died on the cross heart-broken
by sorrow rather than by physical torture.&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>(I lost something here because I was questioning
and doubting within myself, for I have always had
the thought that Christ must have been <i>glad</i> to die.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>He went on:&mdash;&#8220;To heal the broken-hearted is
to say to those who are beset by the remembrance
and the misery of sin, &#8216;My brother, the past is
past&mdash;think not of it to thy perdition; arise and
sin no more.&#8217;&#8221; (All this, and more to the same
purpose, wonderfully beautiful! and I became all
soul&mdash;subdued to listen.) &#8220;There are two ways of
meeting the pressure of misery and heart-break:
first, by trusting to time&#8221; (then followed a quotation
from Schiller&#8217;s &#8220;Wallenstein,&#8221; in reference to grief,
which sounded strange, and yet beautiful, from the
pulpit, &#8220;Was verschmerzte nicht der Mensch?&#8221;&mdash;what
cannot man grieve down?); &#8220;secondly, by
defiance and resistance, setting oneself resolutely to
endure. But Christ taught a different way from
either&mdash;by <i>submission</i>&mdash;by the complete surrender
of our whole being to the will of God.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next part of Christ&#8217;s mission was to preach
deliverance to the captives.&#8221; (Then followed a most
eloquent and beautiful exposition of Christian freedom&mdash;of
who were free; and who were not free, but
properly spiritual captives.) &#8220;To be content within
limitations is freedom; to desire beyond those limitations
is bondage. The bird which is content within
her cage is free; the bird which can fly from tree to
tree, yet desires to soar like the eagle,&mdash;the eagle
which can ascend to the mountain peak yet desires
to reach the height of that sun on which his eye is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
fixed,&mdash;these are in bondage. The man who is not
content within his sphere of duties and powers, but
feels his faculties, his position, his profession; a perpetual
trammel,&mdash;<i>he</i> is spiritually in bondage. The
only freedom is the freedom of the soul, content
within its external limitations, and yet elevated spiritually
far above them by the inward powers and
impulses which lift it up to God.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/illus-024.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="87" width="350" /></div>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><i>Recollections of another Church of England Sermon
preached extempore.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The text was taken from Matt. xii. 42.: &#8220;The Queen of
the South shall rise up in the judgment with this generation,
and shall condemn it,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> preacher began by drawing that distinction
between knowledge and wisdom which so many
comprehend and allow, and so few apply. He then
described the two parties in the great question of
popular education. Those who would base all human
progress on secular instruction, on knowledge in
contradistinction to ignorance, as on light opposed to
darkness;&mdash;and the mistake of those who, taking the
contrary extreme, denounce all secular instruction
imparted to the poor as dangerous, or contemn it as
useless. The error of those who sneer at the triumph
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
of intellect he termed a species of idiocy; and the
error of those who do not see the insufficiency of
knowledge, blind presumption. Then he contrasted
worldly wisdom and spiritual; with a flow of gorgeous
eloquence he enlarged on the picture of worldly
wisdom as exhibited in the character of Solomon, and
of intellect, and admiration for intellect, in the character
of the Queen of Sheba. &#8220;In what consisted
the wisdom of Solomon? He made, as the sacred
history assures us, three thousand proverbs, mostly
prudential maxims relating to conduct in life; the
use and abuse of riches; prosperity and adversity.
His acquirements in natural philosophy seem to
have been confined to the appearances of material
and visible things; the herbs and trees, the beasts
and birds, the creeping things and fishes. His
political wisdom consisted in increasing his wealth, his
dominions, and the number of his subjects and cities.
On his temple he lavished all that art had then
accomplished, and on his own house a world of riches
in gold, and silver, and precious things: but all was
done for his own glory&mdash;nothing for the improvement
or the happiness of his people, who were ground
down by taxes, suffered in the midst of all his magnificence,
and remained ignorant in spite of all his
knowledge. Witness the wars, tyrannies, miseries,
delusions, and idolatries which followed after his
death.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But the Queen of Sheba came not from the
uttermost parts of the earth to view the magnificence
and wonder at the greatness of the King, she came
to hear his wisdom. She came not to ask anything
from him, but to prove him with hard questions.
No idea of worldly gain, or selfish ambition was
in her thoughts; she paid even for the pleasure of
hearing his wise sayings by rare and costly gifts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knowledge is power; but he who worships
knowledge not for its own sake, but for the power it
brings, worships power. Knowledge is riches; but
he who worships knowledge for the sake of all it
bestows, worships riches. The Queen of Sheba
worshipped knowledge solely for its own sake; and
the truths which she sought from the lips of Solomon
she sought for truth&#8217;s sake. She gave, all she could
give, in return, the spicy products of her own land,
treasures of pure gold, and blessings warm from her
heart. The man who makes a voyage to the antipodes
only to behold the constellation of the Southern
Cross, the man who sails to the North to see how the
magnet trembles and varies, these love knowledge
for its own sake, and are impelled by the same enthusiasm
as the Queen of Sheba.&#8221; He went on to
analyse the character of Solomon, and did not treat
him, I thought, with much reverence either as sage
or prophet. He remarked that, &#8220;of the thousand
songs of Solomon one only survives, and that both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
in this song and in his proverbs his meaning has
often been mistaken; it is supposed to be spiritual,
and is interpreted symbolically, when in fact the
plain, obvious, material significance is the true one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continued to this effect,&mdash;but with a power
of language and illustration which I cannot render.
&#8220;We see in Solomon&#8217;s own description of his dominion,
his glory, his wealth, his fame, what his
boasted wisdom achieved; what it could, and what it
could not do for him. What was the end of all his
magnificence? of his worship of the beautiful? of
his intellectual triumphs? of his political subtlety?
of his ships, and his commerce, and his chariots, and
his horses, and his fame which reached to the ends
of the earth? All&mdash;as it is related&mdash;ended in feebleness,
in scepticism, in disbelief of happiness, in
sensualism, idolatry, and dotage! The whole &#8216;Book
of Ecclesiastes,&#8217; fine as it is, presents a picture of
selfishness and epicurism. This was the King of
the Jews! the King of those that know! (<i>Il maestro
di color chi sanno.</i>) Solomon is a type of worldly
wisdom, of desire of knowledge for the sake of all
that knowledge can give. We imitate him when
we would base the happiness of a people on knowledge.
When we have commanded the sun to be
our painter, and the lightning to run on our errands,
what reward have we? Not the increase of happiness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
nor the increase of goodness; nor&mdash;what is
next to both&mdash;our faith in both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem profane to contrast Solomon and
Christ had not our Saviour himself placed that
contrast distinctly before us. He consecrated the
comparison by applying it&mdash;&#8216;Behold a greater than
Solomon is here.&#8217; In quoting these words we do
not presume to bring into comparison the two
<i>natures</i>, but the two intellects&mdash;the two aspects
of truth. Solomon described the external world;
Christ taught the moral law. Solomon illustrated
the aspects of nature; Christ helped the aspirations
of the spirit. Solomon left as a legacy the saying
that &#8216;in much wisdom there is much grief;&#8217; and
Christ preached to us the lowly wisdom which can
consecrate grief; making it lead to the elevation of
our whole being and to ultimate happiness. The
two majesties&mdash;the two kings&mdash;how different! Not
till we are old, and have suffered, and have laid
our experience to heart, do we feel the immeasurable
distance between the teaching of Christ and the
teaching of Solomon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then returning to the Queen of Sheba, he treated
the character as the type of the intellectual woman.
He contrasted her rather favourably with Solomon.
He described with picturesque felicity, her long and
toilsome journey to see, to admire, the man whose
wisdom had made him renowned;&mdash;the mixture of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
enthusiasm and humility which prompted her desire
to learn, to prove the truth of what rumour had
conveyed to her, to commune with him of all that
was in her heart. And she returned to her own
country rich in wise sayings. But did the final
result of all this glory and knowledge reach her
there? and did it shake her faith in him she had
bowed to as the wisest of kings and men?</p>

<p>He then contrasted the character of the Queen of
Sheba with that of Mary, the mother of our Lord,
that feminine type of holiness, of tenderness, of long-suffering;
of sinless purity in womanhood, wifehood,
and motherhood: and rising to more than usual
eloquence and power, he prophesied the regeneration
of all human communities through the social elevation,
the intellect, the purity, and the devotion of
Woman.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<h4><i>From a Sermon (apparently extempore) by a Dissenting
Minister.</i></h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> ascetics of the old times seem to have had a
belief that all sin was in the body; that the spirit
belonged to God, and the body to his adversary the
devil; and that to contemn, ill-treat, and degrade by
every means this frame of ours, so wonderfully, so
fearfully, so exquisitely made, was to please the
Being who made it; and who, for gracious ends, no
doubt, rendered it capable of such admirable development
of strength and beauty. Miserable mistake!</p>

<p>To some, this body is as a prison from which we
are to rejoice to escape by any permitted means: to
others, it is as a palace to be luxuriously kept up and
decorated within and without. But what says Paul
(Cor. vi. 19.),&mdash;&#8220;Know ye not that your body is
the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which
ye have from God, and which is not your own?&#8221;</p>

<p>Surely not less than a temple is that form which
the Divine Redeemer took upon him, and deigned,
for a season, to inhabit; which he consecrated by his
life, sanctified by his death, glorified by his transfiguration,
hallowed and beautified by his resurrection!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>It is because they do not recognise <i>this</i> body as a
temple, built up by God&#8217;s intelligence, as a fitting
sanctuary for the immortal Spirit, and <i>this</i> life equally
with any other form of life as dedicate to Him, that
men fall into such opposite extremes of sin:&mdash;the
spiritual sin which contemns the body, and the sensual
sin which misuses it.</p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> I was at Boston I made the acquaintance
of Father Taylor, the founder of the Sailors&#8217;
Home in that city. He was considered as the apostle
of the seamen, and I was full of veneration for him as
the enthusiastic teacher and philanthropist. But it
is not of his virtues or his labours that I wish to
speak. He struck me in another way, <i>as a poet</i>;
he was a born poet. Until he was five-and-twenty
he had never learned to read, and his reading afterwards
was confined to such books as aided him in
his ministry. He remained an illiterate man to the
last, but his mind was teeming with spontaneous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
imagery, allusion, metaphor. One might almost say
of him,</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">&#8220;He could not ope</span>
<span class="i0">His mouth, but out there flew a trope!&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>These images and allusions had a freshness, an originality,
and sometimes an oddity that was quite startling,
and they were generally, but not always, borrowed
from his former profession&mdash;that of a sailor.</p>

<p class="tb">One day we met him in the street. He told us
in a melancholy voice that he had been burying a
child, and alluded almost with emotion to the great
number of infants he had buried lately. Then after
a pause, striking his stick on the ground and looking
upwards, he added, &#8220;There must be something wrong
somewhere! there&#8217;s a storm brewing, when the doves
are all flying aloft!&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">One evening in conversation with me, he compared
the English and the Americans to Jacob&#8217;s vine, which,
planted on one side of the wall, grew over it and
hung its boughs and clusters on the other side,&mdash;&#8220;but
it is still the same vine, nourished from the same
root!&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">On one occasion when I attended his chapel, the
sermon was preceded by a long prayer in behalf of
an afflicted family, one of whose members had died<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
or been lost in a whaling expedition to the South
Seas. In the midst of much that was exquisitely
pathetic and poetical, refined ears were startled by
such a sentence as this,&mdash;&#8220;Grant, O Lord! that this
rod of chastisement be sanctified, every twig of it, to
the edification of their souls!&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">Then immediately afterwards he prayed that the
Divine Comforter might be near the bereaved father
&#8220;when his aged heart went forth from his bosom to
flutter round the far southern grave of his boy!&#8221;
Praying for others of the same family who were on
the wide ocean, he exclaimed, stretching forth his
arms, &#8220;O save them! O guard them! thou angel
of the deep!&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">On another occasion, speaking of the insufficiency
of the moral principles without religious feelings, he
exclaimed, &#8220;Go heat your ovens with snowballs!
What! shall I send you to heaven with such an
icicle in your pocket? I might as well put a millstone
round your neck to teach you to swim!&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">He was preaching against violence and cruelty:&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t
talk to me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;of the savages! a
ruffian in the midst of Christendom is the savage of
savages. He is as a man freezing in the sun&#8217;s heat,
groping in the sun&#8217;s light, a straggler in paradise, an
alien in heaven!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>In his chapel all the principal seats in front of the
pulpit and down the centre aisle were filled by the
sailors. We ladies, and gentlemen, and strangers,
whom curiosity had brought to hear him, were ranged
on each side; he would on no account allow us to
take the best places. On one occasion, as he was denouncing
hypocrisy, luxury, and vanity, and other
vices of more civilised life, he said emphatically, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t mean <i>you</i> before me here,&#8221; looking at the sailors;
&#8220;I believe you are wicked enough, but honest fellows
in some sort, for you profess less, not more,
than you practise; but I mean to touch <i>starboard</i> and
<i>larboard</i> there!&#8221; stretching out both hands with
the forefinger extended, and looking at us on either
side till we quailed.</p>

<p class="tb">He compared the love of God in sending Christ
upon earth to that of the father of a seaman who
sends his eldest and most beloved son, the hope of
the family, to bring back the younger one, lost on his
voyage, and missing when his ship returned to port.</p>

<p class="tb">Alluding to the carelessness of Christians, he used
the figure of a mariner, steering into port through a
narrow dangerous channel, &#8220;false lights here, rocks
there, shifting sand banks on one side, breakers on
the other; and who, instead of fixing his attention to
keep the head of his vessel right, and to obey the
instructions of the pilot as he sings out from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
wheel, throws the pilot overboard, lashes down the
helm, and walks the deck whistling, with his hands
in the pockets of his jacket.&#8221; Here, suiting the action
to the word, he put on a true sailor-like look of defiant
jollity;&mdash;changed in a moment to an expression
of horror as he added, &#8220;See! See! she drifts
to destruction!&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">One Sunday he attempted to give to his sailor congregation
an idea of Redemption. He began with an
eloquent description of a terrific storm at sea, rising
to fury through all its gradations; then, amid the
waves, a vessel is seen labouring in distress and
driving on a lee shore. The masts bend and break,
and go overboard; the sails are rent, the helm unshipped,
they spring a leak! the vessel begins to fill,
the water gains on them; she sinks deeper, deeper,
<i>deeper! deeper!</i> He bent over the pulpit repeating
the last words again and again; his voice became low
and hollow. The faces of the sailors as they gazed
up at him with their mouths wide open, and their
eyes fixed, I shall never forget. Suddenly stopping,
and looking to the farthest end of the chapel as into
space, he exclaimed, with a piercing cry of exultation,
&#8220;A life boat! a life boat!&#8221; Then looking down
upon his congregation, most of whom had sprung to
their feet in an ecstasy of suspense, he said in a deep
impressive tone, and extending his arms, &#8220;<i>Christ is
that life boat!</i>&#8221;</p>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<h5>RELIGION AND SCIENCE.</h5>

<p>&#8220;It is true, that science has not made Nature as
expressive of God in the first instance, or to the beginner
in religion, as it was in earlier times. Science
reveals a rigid, immutable order; and this to common
minds looks much like self-subsistence, and does not
manifest intelligence, which is full of life, variety,
and progressive operation. Men, in the days of
their ignorance, saw an immediate Divinity accomplishing
an immediate purpose, or expressing an immediate
feeling, in every sudden, striking change of
nature&mdash;in a storm, the flight of a bird, &amp;c.; and
Nature, thus interpreted, became the sign of a present,
deeply interested Deity. Science undoubtedly
brings vast aids, but it is to <i>prepared</i> minds, to those
who have begun in another school. The greatest aid
it yields consists in the revelation it makes of the
Infinite. It aids us not so much by showing us
marks of design in this or that particular thing as by
showing the <i>Infinite</i> in the <i>finite</i>. Science does this
office when it unfolds to us the unity of the universe,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
which thus becomes the sign, the efflux of one unbounded
intelligence, when it reveals to us in every
work of Nature infinite connections, the influences of
all-pervading laws&mdash;when it shows us in each created
thing unfathomable, unsearchable depths, to which
our intelligence is altogether unequal. Thus Nature
explored by science is a witness of the Infinite. It
is also a witness to the same truth by its beauty; for
what is so undefined, so mysterious as beauty?&#8221;&mdash;<i>Dr.
Channing.</i></p>

<h4>DR. ARNOLD.</h4>

<h5>3.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">sat</span> up till half-past two this morning reading
Dr. Arnold&#8217;s &#8220;Life and Letters,&#8221; and have my
soul full of him to-day.</p>

<p>On the whole I cannot say that the perusal of this
admirable book has changed any notion in my mind,
or added greatly to my stock of ideas. There was
no height of inspiration, or eloquence, or power, to
which I looked <i>up</i>; no profound depth of thought
or feeling into which I looked <i>down</i>; no <i>new</i> lights;
no <i>new</i> guides; no absolutely <i>new</i> aspects of things
human or spiritual.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I never read a book of the
kind with a more harmonious sense of pleasure and
<i>approbation</i>,&mdash;if the word be not from me presumptuous.
While I read page after page, the
mind which was unfolded before me seemed to me a
brother&#8217;s mind&mdash;the spirit, a kindred spirit. It was
the improved, the elevated, the enlarged, the enriched,
the every-way superior reflection of my own
intelligence, but it was certainly <i>that</i>. I felt it so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
from beginning to end. Exactly the reverse was the
feeling with which I laid down the Life and Letters
of Southey. I was instructed, amused, interested;
I profited and admired; but with the <i>man</i> Southey
I had no sympathies: my mind stood off from his;
the poetical intellect attracted, the material of the
character repelled me. I liked the embroidery, but
the texture was disagreeable, repugnant. Now with
regard to Dr. Arnold, my entire sympathy with
the character, with the <i>material</i> of the character, did
not extend to all its manifestations. I liked the texture
better than the embroidery;&mdash;perhaps, because
of my feminine organisation.</p>

<p>Nor did my admiration of the intellect extend to
the acceptance of <i>all</i> the opinions which emanated
from it; perhaps because from the manner these
were enunciated, or merely touched upon (in letters
chiefly), I did not comprehend clearly the reasoning
on which they may have been founded. Perhaps, if
I had done so, I must have respected them more,
perhaps have been convinced by them; so large, so
candid, so rich in knowledge, and apparently so
logical, was the mind which admitted them.</p>

<p>And yet this excellent, admirable man, seems to
have <i>feared</i> God, in the common-place sense of the
word fear. He considered the Jews as out of the pale
of equality; he was against their political emancipation
from a hatred of Judaism. He subscribed to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Athanasian Creed, which stuck even in George the
Third&#8217;s orthodox throat. He believed in what Coleridge
could not admit, in the existence of the spirit
of evil as a person. He had an idea that the Church
<i>of God</i> may be destroyed by an Antichrist; he speaks
of such a consummation as possible, as probable,
as impending; as if any institution really from God
could be destroyed by an adverse power!&mdash;and he
thought that a lawyer could not be a Christian.</p>

<h5>4.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smcap">ertain</span> passages filled me with astonishment as
coming from a churchman, particularly what he
says of the sacraments (vol. ii. pp. 75. 113.); and in
another place, where he speaks of &#8220;the <i>pestilent</i> distinction
between clergy and laity;&#8221; and where he says,
&#8220;I hold that one form of Church government is exactly
as much according to Christ&#8217;s will as another.&#8221; And
in another place he speaks of the Anglican Church
(with reference to Henry VIII. as its father, and
Elizabeth as its foster-mother), as &#8220;the child of regal
and aristocratical selfishness and unprincipled tyranny,
who has never dared to speak boldly to the great,
but has contented herself with lecturing the poor;&#8221;
but he forgot at the moment the trial of the bishops
in James&#8217;s time, and their noble stand against regal
authority.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<h5>5.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">ith</span> regard to conservatism (vol. ii. pp. 19. 62.),
he seems to mean&mdash;as I understand the whole
passage,&mdash;that it is a good <i>instinct</i> but a bad <i>principle</i>.
Yet as a principle is it, as he says, &#8220;always wrong?&#8221;
Though as the adversary of progress, it must be
always wrong, yet as the adversary of change it <i>may</i>
be sometimes right.</p>

<h5>6.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> remarks that most of those who are above
sectarianism are in general indifferent to Christianity,
while almost all who profess to value Christianity
seem, when they are brought to the test, to
care only for their own sect. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;it
is manifest to me, that all our education must be
Christian, and not be sectarian.&#8221; Yet the whole aim
of education up to this time has been, in this country,
eminently sectarian, and every statesman who has attempted
to place it on a broader basis has been either
wrecked or stranded.</p>

<p>&#8220;All sects,&#8221; he says in another place, &#8220;have had
among them marks of Christ&#8217;s Catholic Church in the
graces of his Spirit and the confession of his name,&#8221;
and he seems to wish that some one would compile a
book showing side by side what professors of all sects
have done for the good of Christ&#8217;s Church,&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
martyrdoms, the missionary labours of Catholics,
Protestants, Arians, &amp;c.; &#8220;a grand field,&#8221; he calls
it,&mdash;and so it were; but it lies fallow up to this
time.</p>

<h5>7.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> philosophy of medicine, I imagine, is at zero;
our practice is empirical, and seems hardly more
than a course of guessing, more or less happy.&#8221; In
another place (vol. ii. p. 72.), he says, &#8220;yet I honour
medicine as the most beneficent of all professions.&#8221;</p>

<h5>8.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> says (vol. ii. p. 42.), &#8220;Narrow-mindedness tends
to wickedness, because it does not extend its
watchfulness to every part of our moral nature.&#8221;
&#8220;Thus, a man may have one or more virtues, such
as are according to his favourite ideas, in great perfection;
and still be nothing, because these ideas are
his idols, and, worshipping them with all his heart,
there is a portion of his heart, more or less considerable,
left without its proper object, guide, and
nourishment; and so this portion is left to the
dominion of evil,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>(One might ask <i>how</i>, if a man worship these ideas
with <i>all</i> his heart, a portion could be left? but the
sense is so excellent, I cannot quarrel with a slight
inaccuracy in the expression. I never quite understood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
before why it is difficult to subscribe to the
truth of the phrase &#8220;He is a good but a narrow-minded
man,&#8221; but <i>felt</i> the incompatibility.)</p>

<h5>9.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> says &#8220;the word <i>useful</i> implies the idea of good
robbed of its nobleness.&#8221; Is this true? the <i>useful</i>
is the <i>good</i> applied to practical purposes; it need not,
therefore, be less noble. The nobleness lies in the
spirit in which it is so applied.</p>

<h5>10.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smcap">enthamism</span> (what <i>is</i> it?), Puritanism, Judaism,
how he hates them! I suppose, because he
<i>fears</i> God and <i>fears</i> for the Church of God. Hatred
of all kinds seems to originate in fear.</p>

<h5>11.</h5>

<p>What he says of conscience, very remarkable!</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;M</span><span class="smcap">en</span> get embarrassed by the common cases
of a misguided conscience: but a compass may be out
of order as well as a conscience; and you can trace
the deranging influence on the latter quite as surely
as on the former. The needle may point due south
if you hold a powerful magnet in that direction; still
the compass, generally speaking, is a true and sure
guide,&#8221; &amp;c.; and then he adds, &#8220;he who believes his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
conscience to be God&#8217;s law, by obeying it obeys
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think there would be much to say about all this
passage relating to conscience, nor am I sure that I
quite understand it. Derangement of the intellect
is madness; is not derangement of the conscience
also madness? might it not be induced, as we bring
on a morbid state of the other faculties, by over use
and abuse? by giving it more than its due share of
power in the commonwealth of the mind? It should
preside, not tyrannise; rule, not exercise a petty
cramping despotism. A healthy courageous conscience
gives to the powers, instincts, impulses, fair
play; and having once settled the order of government
with a strong hand, is not always meddling
though always watchful.</p>

<p>Then again, how is conscience &#8220;God&#8217;s law?&#8221;
Conscience is not the law, but the interpreter of the
law; it does not teach the difference between right
and wrong, it only impels us to do what we believe
to be right, and smites us when we <i>think</i> we have
been wrong. How is it that many have done wrong,
and every day do wrong for conscience&#8217; sake?&mdash;and
does that sanctify the wrong in the eyes of God, as
well as in those of John Huss?<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<h5>12.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;P</span><span class="smcap">rayer,&#8221;</span> he says, &#8220;and kindly intercourse with
the poor, are the two great safeguards of
spiritual life&mdash;its more than food and raiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>True; but there is something higher than this fed
and clothed spiritual life; something more difficult,
yet less conscious.</p>

<h5>13.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> allusion to Coleridge, he says very truly, that
the power of contemplation becomes diseased
and perverted when it is the main employment of
life. But to the same great intellect he does beautiful
justice in another passage. &#8220;Coleridge seemed
to me to love truth really, and, therefore, truth presented
herself to him, not negatively, as she does
to many minds, who can see that the objections

curious to see two such men as Arnold and Carlyle
both overwhelmed with a terror of the magnitude of
the mischiefs they see impending over us. They are
oppressed with the anticipation of evil as with a sense

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> says, &#8220;The whole subject of the brute creation
is to me one of such painful mystery, that I dare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
not approach it.&#8221; This is very striking from such a
man. How deep, consciously or unconsciously, does
this feeling lie in many minds!</p>

<p>Bayle had already termed the acts, motives, and
feelings of the lower order of animals, &#8220;un des
plus profonds ab&icirc;mes sur quoi notre raison peut
s&#8217;exerciser.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is nothing, as I have sometimes thought, in
which men so blindly sin as in their appreciation and
treatment of the whole lower order of creatures. It
is affirmed that love and mercy towards animals are
not inculcated by any direct precept of Christianity,
but surely they are included in its spirit; yet it has
been remarked that cruelty towards animals is far
more common in Western Christendom than in the
East. With the Mahometan and Brahminical races
humanity to animals, and the sacredness of life in all
its forms, is much more of a religious principle than
among ourselves.</p>

<p>Bacon, in his &#8220;Advancement of Learning,&#8221; does
not think it beneath his philosophy to point out as a
part of human morals, and a condition of human improvement,
justice and mercy to the lower animals&mdash;&#8220;the
extension of a noble and excellent principle of
compassion to the creatures subject to man.&#8221; &#8220;The
Turks,&#8221; he says, &#8220;though a cruel and sanguinary
nation both in descent and discipline, give alms to
brutes, and suffer them not to be tortured.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>It should seem as if the primitive Christians, by
laying so much stress upon a future life in contradistinction
to this life, and placing the lower
creatures out of the pale of hope, placed them at the
same time out of the pale of sympathy, and thus laid
the foundation for this utter disregard of animals in
the light of our fellow creatures. The definition of
virtue among the early Christians was the same as
Paley&#8217;s&mdash;that it was good performed for the sake of
ensuring everlasting happiness&mdash;which of course
excluded all the so-called brute creatures. Kind,
loving, submissive, conscientious, much enduring, we
know them to be; but because we deprive them of
all stake in the future, because they have no selfish
calculated aim, these are not virtues; yet if we say
&#8220;a <i>vicious</i> horse,&#8221; why not say a <i>virtuous</i> horse?</p>

<p>The following passage, bearing curiously enough
on the most abstruse part of the question, I found in
Hallam&#8217;s Literature of the Middle Ages:&mdash;&#8220;Few,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;at present, who believe in the immateriality
of the human soul, would deny the same to
an elephant; but it must be owned that the discoveries
of zoology have pushed this to consequences
which some might not readily adopt. The spiritual
being of a sponge revolts a little our prejudices; yet
there is no resting-place, and we must admit this, or
be content to sink ourselves into a mass of medullary
fibre. Brutes have been as slowly emancipated in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
philosophy as some classes of mankind have been in
civil polity; their souls, we see, were almost universally
disputed to them at the end of the seventeenth
century, even by those who did not absolutely
bring them down to machinery. Even within the
recollection of many, it was common to deny them
any kind of reasoning faculty, and to solve their
most sagacious actions by the vague word instinct.
We have come of late years to think better of our
humble companions; and, as usual in similar cases,
the preponderant bias seems rather too much of a
levelling character.&#8221;</p>

<p>When natural philosophers speak of &#8220;the higher
reason and more limited instincts of man,&#8221; as compared
with animals, do they mean savage man or
cultivated man? In the savage man the instincts
have a power, a range, a certitude, like those of
animals. As the mental faculties become expanded
and refined the instincts become subordinate. In
tame animals are the instincts as strong as in wild
animals? Can we not, by a process of training, substitute
an entirely different set of motives and
habits?</p>

<p>Why, in managing animals, do men in general
make brutes of themselves to address what is most
<i>brute</i> in the lower creature, as if it had not been
demonstrated that in using our higher faculties, our
reason and benevolence, we develop sympathetically
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
higher powers in <i>them</i>, and in subduing them through
what is best within us, raise them and bring them
nearer to ourselves?</p>

<p>In general the more we can gather of facts, the
nearer we are to the elucidation of theoretic truth.
But with regard to animals, the multiplication of
facts only increases our difficulties and puts us to
confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we otherwise explain animal instincts than
by supposing that the Deity himself is virtually the
active and present moving principle within them?
If we deny them <i>soul</i>, we must admit that they have
some spirit direct from God, what we call <i>unerring</i>
instinct, which holds the place of it.&#8221; This is the
opinion which Newton adopts. Then are we to
infer that the reason of man removes him further
from God than the animals, since we cannot offend
God in our instincts, only in our reason? and that
the superiority of the human animal lies in the power
of sinning? Terrible power! terrible privilege! out
of which we deduce the law of progress and the
necessity for a future life.</p>

<p>The following passage bearing on the subject is
from Bentham:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The day may come when the rest of the animal
creation may acquire those rights which never could
have been withholden from them but by the hand of
tyranny. It may come one day to be recognised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
that the number of legs, the villosity of the skin, or
the termination of the <i>os sacrum</i>, are reasons insufficient
for abandoning a sensitive being to the caprice
of a tormentor. What else is it that should trace
the insuperable line? is it the faculty of reason, or,
perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown
horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational as
well as a more conversable animal than an infant of
a day, a week, or even a month old. But suppose
the case were otherwise, what would it avail? The
question is not, &#8216;can they reason?&#8217; nor &#8216;can they
speak?&#8217; but &#8216;can they suffer?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not remember ever to have heard the kind
and just treatment of animals enforced upon Christian
principles or made the subject of a sermon.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">nce</span>, when I was at Vienna, there was a dread
of hydrophobia, and orders were given to
massacre all the dogs which were found unclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
or uncollared in the city or suburbs. Men were employed
for this purpose, and they generally carried
a short heavy stick, which they flung at the poor
proscribed animal with such certain aim as either
to kill or maim it mortally at one blow. It
happened one day that, close to the edge of the river,
near the Ferdinand&#8217;s-Br&uuml;cke, one of these men
flung his stick at a wretched dog, but with such bad
aim that it fell into the river. The poor animal,
following his instinct or his teaching, immediately
plunged in, redeemed the stick, and laid it down at
the feet of its owner, who, snatching it up, dashed
out the creature&#8217;s brains.</p>

<p>I wonder what the Athenians would have done to
such a man? they who banished the judge of the
Areopagus because he flung away the bird which
had sought shelter in his bosom?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> in Italy he writes:&mdash;&#8220;It is almost awful
to look at the beauty which surrounds me and
then think of moral evil. It seems as if heaven and

us and from each other, were close at hand and on
each other&#8217;s confines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might but the sense of moral evil be as strong
in me as is my delight in external beauty!&#8221;</p>

<p>A prayer I echo, Amen! if by the <i>sense</i> he mean
the abhorrence of it; otherwise, to be perpetually
haunted with the perception of moral evil were
dreadful; yet, on the other hand, I am half ashamed
sometimes of a conscious shrinking within myself
from the sense of moral evil, merely as I should
shrink from external filth and deformity, as hateful
to perception and recollection, rather than as hateful
to God and subversive of goodness.</p>

<h5>25.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">ere</span> is a very striking passage. He says, &#8220;A
great school is very trying; it never can pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>sent
images of rest and peace; and when the spring
and activity of youth are altogether unsanctified by
anything pure and elevated in its desires, it becomes
a spectacle that is dizzying and almost more morally
distressing than the shouts and gambols of a set of
lunatics. It is very startling to see so much of sin
combined with so little of sorrow. In a parish,
amongst the poor, whatever of sin exists there is sure
also to be enough of suffering: poverty, sickness, and
old age are mighty tamers and chastisers. But, with
boys of the richer classes, one sees nothing but
plenty, health, and youth; and these are really awful
to behold, when one must feel that they are unblessed.
On the other hand, few things are more
beautiful than when one does see all holy and noble
thoughts and principles, not the forced growth of
pain, or infirmity, or privation, but springing up as
by God&#8217;s immediate planting, in a sort of garden of
all that is fresh and beautiful; full of so much hope
for this world as well as for heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this testimony of a schoolmaster let us add the
testimony of a schoolboy. De Quincey thus describes
in himself the transition from boyhood to manhood:
&#8220;Then first and suddenly were brought powerfully
before me the change which was worked in the
aspects of society by the presence of woman; woman,
pure, thoughtful, noble, coming before me as Pandora
crowned with perfections. Right over against this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
ennobling spectacle, with equal suddenness, I placed
the odious spectacle of schoolboy society&mdash;no matter
in what region of the earth,&mdash;schoolboy society, so
frivolous in the matter of its disputes, often so
brutal in the manner; so childish and yet so remote
from simplicity; so foolishly careless, and yet so
revoltingly selfish; dedicated ostensibly to learning,
and yet beyond any section of human beings so conspicuously
ignorant.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a reverse to this picture, as I hope and
believe. If I have met with those who looked back
on their school-days with horror, as having first contaminated
them with &#8220;evil communication,&#8221; I have
met with others whose remembrances were all of
sunshine, of early friendships, of joyous sports.</p>

<p>Nor do I think that a large school composed
wholly of girls is in any respect better. In the low
languid tone of mind, the petulant tempers, the
small spitefulnesses, the cowardly concealments, the
compressed or ill-directed energies, the precocious
vanities and affectations, many such congregations of
<i>Femmelettes</i> would form a worthy pendant to the picture
of boyish turbulence and vulgarity drawn by
De Quincey.</p>

<p>I am convinced from my own recollections, and
from all I have learned from experienced teachers in
large schools, that one of the most fatal mistakes in
the training of children has been the too early separation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
of the sexes. I say, <i>has been</i>, because I find
that everywhere this most dangerous prejudice has
been giving way before the light of truth and a more
general acquaintance with that primal law of nature,
which ought to teach us that the more we can assimilate
on a large scale the public to the domestic training,
the better for all. There exists still, the impression&mdash;in
the higher classes especially&mdash;that in
early education, the mixture of the two sexes would
tend to make the girls masculine and the boys effeminate,
but experience shows us that it is all the
other way. Boys learn a manly and protecting tenderness,
and the girls become at once more feminine
and more truthful. Where this association has
begun early enough, that is, before five years old,
and has been continued till about ten or twelve, it
has uniformly worked well; on this point the evidence
is unanimous and decisive. So long ago as
1812, Francis Horner, in describing a school he
visited at Enmore, near Bridgewater, speaks with
approbation of the boys and the girls standing up
together in the same class: it is the first mention, I
find, of this innovation on the old collegiate, or
charity-school plan,&mdash;itself a continuation of the
monkish discipline. He says, &#8220;I liked much the
placing the boys and girls together at an early age;
it gave the boys a new spur to emulation.&#8221; When
I have seen a class of girls stand up together, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
has been a sort of empty tittering, a vacancy in the
faces, an inertness, which made it, as I thought, very
up-hill work for the teacher; so when it was a class
of boys, there has been often a sluggishness&mdash;a tendency
to ruffian tricks&mdash;requiring perpetual effort on
the part of the master. In teaching a class of boys
and girls, accustomed to stand up together, there is
little or nothing of this. They are brighter, readier,
better behaved; there is a kind of mutual influence
working for good; and if there be emulation, it is
not mingled with envy or jealousy. Mischief, such
as might be apprehended, is in this case far less
likely to arise than where boys and girls, habitually
separated from infancy, are first thrown together,
just at the age when the feelings are first awakened
and the association has all the excitement of novelty.
A very intelligent schoolmaster assured me that he
had had more trouble with a class of fifty boys, than
with a school of three hundred boys and girls together
(in the midst of whom I found him); and that
there were no inconveniences resulting which a wise
and careful and efficient superintendence could not
control. &#8220;There is,&#8221; said he, &#8220;not only more emulation,
more quickness of brain, but altogether a
superior healthiness of tone, body and mind, where
the boys and girls are trained together till about ten
years old; and it extends into their after life:&mdash;I
should say because it is in accordance with the laws
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
of God in forming us with mutual sympathies, moral
and intellectual, and mutual dependence for help
from the very beginning of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is curious enough, I find many people&mdash;fathers,
mothers, teachers,&mdash;who are agreed that in
the schools for the lower classes, the two sexes may
be safely and advantageously associated, yet have a
sort of horror of the idea of such an innovation in
schools for the higher classes. One would like to
know the reason for such a distinction, instead of
being encountered, as is usual, by a sneer or a vile
innuendo.</p>

<h5>LIFE AND LETTERS, 1852.</h5>

<h5>26.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> a letter to a young student in philology there are
noble passages in which I truly sympathise. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
says, among other things: &#8220;I wish you had less
pleasure in satires, not excepting those of Horace.
Turn to the works which elevate the heart, in which
you contemplate great men and great events, and
live in a higher world. Turn away from those which
represent the mean and contemptible side of ordinary
circumstances and degenerate days: they are not
suitable for the young, who in ancient times would
not have been suffered to have them in their hands.
Homer, &AElig;schylus, Sophocles, Pindar,&mdash;these are
the poets for youth.&#8221; And again: &#8220;Do not read
the ancient authors in order to make &aelig;sthetic reflections
on them, but in order to drink in their spirit
and to fill your soul with their thoughts; and in
order to gain that by reading which you would have
gained by reverently listening to the discourses of
great men.&#8221;</p>

<p>We should turn to works of art with the same
feeling.</p>

<p>On the whole, all my own educational experience
has shown me the dangerous&mdash;in some cases fatal&mdash;effects
on the childish intellect, where precocious
criticism was encouraged, and where caricatures and
ugly disproportioned figures, expressing vile or ridiculous
emotions, were placed before the eyes of
children, as a means of amusement.</p>

<p>If I were a legislator I would forbid travesties and
ridiculous burlesques of Shakspeare&#8217;s finest and most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
serious dramas to be acted in our theatres. That
this has been done and recently (as in the case of the
Merchant of Venice) seems to me a national disgrace.</p>

<h5>27.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is strange, confounding, to hear Niebuhr speak
thus of Goethe:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to think that Goethe is utterly
destitute of susceptibility to impressions from the fine
arts.&#8221;(!!) He afterwards does more justice to Goethe&mdash;certainly
one of the profoundest critics in art who
ever lived; although I am inclined to think that
his was an educated perception rather than a natural
sensibility. Niebuhr&#8217;s criticism on Goethe&#8217;s Italian
travels,&mdash;on Goethe&#8217;s want of sympathy with the
people,&mdash;his regarding the whole country and nation
simply as a sort of bazaar of art and antiquities,
an exhibition of beauty and a recreation for himself:
his habit of surveying all moral and intellectual greatness,
all that speaks to the heart, with a kind of
patronising superiority, as if created for his use,&mdash;and
finding amusement in the folly, degeneracy, and
corruption of the people;&mdash;all this appears to me
admirable, and so far I had strong sympathy with
Niebuhr; for I well remember that in reading
Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Italianische Reise,&#8221; I had the same perception
of the artless and the superficial in point
of feeling, in the midst of so much that was fine and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
valuable in criticism. It is well to be artistic in art,
but not to walk about the world <i>en artiste</i>, studying
humanity, and the deepest human interests, as if they
were <i>art</i>.</p>

<p>Niebuhr afterwards says, in speaking of Rome,
&#8220;I am sickened here of art, as I should be of sweetmeats
instead of bread.&#8221; So it <i>must</i> be where art is
separated wholly from morals.</p>

<h5>28.</h5>

and the combination is not peculiar to the Italians,

self-applause.)</p>

<p>I am quite sure, from my own experience of
children who have been allowed to learn penitential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
psalms and hymns, that they think of wickedness as
a sort of thing which gives them self-importance.</p>

<h5>30.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;O</span><span class="smcap">nly</span> what the mind takes in willingly can it
assimilate with itself, and make its own, part
of its life.&#8221;</p>

<p>A truism of the greatest value in education; but
who thinks of it when cramming children&#8217;s minds
with all sorts of distasteful heterogeneous things?</p>

<h5>31.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> reflection has become too one-sided and
too domineering over a deeply feeling heart,
it is apt to lead us into errors in our treatment of
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all that follows&mdash;very wise! for the want of
this reflection leaves us stranded and wrecked through
feeling and perception merely.</p>

<h5>32.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">V</span><span class="smcap">ery</span> curious and interesting, as a trait of character
and feeling, is the passage in which he
represents himself, in the dangerous confinement of
his second wife, as praying to his first wife for
succour. &#8220;In my terrible anxiety,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I
prayed most earnestly, and entreated my Milly, too,
for help. I comforted Gretchen by telling her that
Milly would send help. When she was at the worst,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
she sighed out, &#8216;Ah, cannot your Amelia send me a
blessing?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>This is curious from a Protestant and a philosopher.
It shows that there may be something
nearly allied to our common nature in the Roman
Catholic invocation to the saints, and to the souls of
the dead.</p>

<h5>33.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smcap">iebuhr</span>, speaking of a lady (Madame von der
Recke, I think,&mdash;the &#8220;Elise&#8221; of Goethe) who
had patronised him, says, &#8220;I will receive roses
and myrtles from female hands, but no laurels.&#8221;</p>

<p>This makes one smile; for most of the laurels
which Niebuhr will receive in this country will be
through female hands&mdash;through the admirable translation
and arrangement of his life and letters by
Susanna Winkworth.</p>

<h5>34.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> following I read with cordial agreement:&mdash;&#8220;While
I am ready to adopt any well-grounded
opinion&#8221; (regarding, I suppose, mere facts,
or speculations as to things), &#8220;my inmost soul revolts
against receiving the judgment of others respecting
persons; and whenever I have done so I
have bitterly repented of it.&#8221;</p>

<h5>35.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> says, &#8220;I cannot worship the abstraction of
Virtue. She only charms me when she ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>dresses
herself to my heart, and speaks thus the love
from which she springs. I really love nothing but
what actually exists.&#8221;</p>

<p>What <i>does</i> actually exist to us but that which we
believe in? and where we strongly love do we not
believe sometimes in the <i>unreal</i>? is it not <i>then</i> the
existing and the actual to us?</p>

<h5>36.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;A</span> <span class="smcap">faculty</span> of a quite peculiar kind, and for which
we have no word, is the recognition of the
incomprehensible. It is something which distinguishes
the seer from the ordinary learned man.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in religion this is <i>faith</i>. Does Niebuhr admit
this kind of faith, &#8220;the recognition of the incomprehensible,&#8221;
in philosophy, and not in religion? for he
often complains of the want in himself of any faith
but an historic faith.</p>

<h5>37.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> times of good fortune it is easy to appear
great&mdash;nay, even to act greatly; but in
misfortune very difficult. The greatest man will
commit blunders in misfortune, because the want of
proportion between his means and his ends progressively
increases, and his inward strength is
exhausted in fruitless efforts.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is true; but under all extremes of good or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
evil fortune we are apt to commit mistakes, because
the tide of the mind does not flow equally, but rushes
along impetuously in a flood, or brokenly and distractedly
in a rocky channel, where its strength is
exhausted in conflict and pain. The extreme pressure
of circumstances will produce extremes of feeling in
minds of a sensitive rather than a firm cast.</p>

<h5>38.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> next passage is curious as a scholar&#8217;s opinion
of &#8220;free trade&#8221; in the year 1810; though I believe
the phrase &#8220;free trade&#8221; was not even invented at
that time&mdash;certainly not in use in the statesman&#8217;s
vocabulary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you will admit that commerce is a
good thing, and the first requisite in the life of any
nation. It appears to me, that this much has now
been palpably demonstrated, namely, that an advanced
and complicated social condition like this in which we
live can only be maintained by establishing mutual
relationships between the most remote nations; and
that the limitation of commerce would, like the
sapping of a main pillar, inevitably occasion the fall
of the whole edifice; and also that commerce is so
essentially beneficial and in accordance with man&#8217;s
nature, that the well-being of each nation is an
advantage to all the nations that stand in connection
with it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>It is strange how long we have been (forty years,
and more) in recognising these simple principles;
and in Germany, where they were first enunciated,
they are not recognised yet.</p>

<h4>CHARACTER OF DEMADES.</h4>

<h5>39.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;B</span><span class="smcap">y</span> his wit and his talent, and more especially by
his gift as an improvisatore, he rose so high that
he exercised a great influence upon the people, and
sometimes was more popular even than Demosthenes.
With a shamelessness amounting to honesty,
he bluntly told the people everything he felt and what
all the populace felt with him. When hearing such
a man the populace felt at their ease: he gave
them the feeling that they might be wicked without
being disgraced, and this excites with such people a
feeling of gratitude. There is a remarkable passage
in Plato, where he shows that those who deliver
hollow speeches, without being in earnest, have no
power or influence; whereas others, who are devoid
of mental culture, but say in a straightforward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
manner what they think and feel, exercise great
power. It was this which in the eighteenth century
gave the materialist philosophy in France such enormous
influence with the higher classes; for they were
told there was no need to be ashamed of the vulgarest
sensuality; formerly people had been ashamed,
but now a man learned that he might be a brutal
sensualist, provided he did not offend against elegant
manners and social conventionalism. People rejoiced
at hearing a man openly and honestly say what they
themselves felt. Demades was a remarkable character.
He was not a bad man; and I like him much
better than Eschines.&#8221;</p>

<p>What an excuse, what a sanction is here for the
demagogues who direct the worst passions of men
to the worst and the most selfish purposes, and the
most debasing consequences! Demades &#8220;not a bad
man?&#8221; then what <i>is</i> a bad man?</p>

<h4>LORD BACON.</h4>

<h5>(1849.)</h5>

<h5>40.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was not the pure knowledge of nature and
universality, but it was the proud knowledge
of good and evil, with an intent in man to give the
law unto himself, which was the form of the first
temptation.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, in this sense, the first temptation is only the
type of the perpetual and ever-present temptation&mdash;the
temptation into which we are to fall through
necessity, that we may rise through love.</p>

<h5>41.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">ere</span> is an excellent passage&mdash;a severe commentary
on the unsound, un-christian, unphilosophical
distinction between morals and politics in government:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Although men bred in learning are perhaps to
seek in points of convenience and reasons of state
and accommodations for the present, yet, on the
other hand, to recompense this they are perfect in
those same plain grounds of religion, justice, honour,
and moral virtue which, if they be well and watchfully
pursued, there will be seldom use of those other
expedients, no more than of physic in a sound, well-directed
body.&#8221;</p>

<h5>42.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;N</span><span class="smcap">ow</span> (in the time of Lord Bacon, that is,) now
sciences are delivered to be believed and accepted,
and not to be farther discovered; and therefore,
sciences stand at a clog, and have done for many
ages.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the present time, this is true only, or especially,
of theology as an art, and divinity as a science;
so made by the schoolmen of former ages, and not
yet emancipated.</p>

<h5>43.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;G</span><span class="smcap">enerally</span> he perceived in men of devout simplicity
this opinion, that the secrets of nature
were the secrets of God, part of that glory into which
man is not to press too boldly.&#8221;</p>

<p>God has placed no limits to the exercise of the
intellect he has given us on this side of the grave.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
But not the less will he keep his own secrets from
us. Has he not proved it? who has opened that
door to the knowledge of a future being which it
has pleased him to keep shut fast, though watched
by hope and by faith?</p>

<h5>44.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> Christian philosophy of these latter times
appears to be foreshadowed in the following
sentence, where he speaks of such as have ventured
to deduce and confirm the truth of the Christian
religion from the principles and authorities of philosophers:
&#8220;Thus with great pomp and solemnity
celebrating the intermarriage of faith and sense as a
lawful conjunction, and soothing the minds of men
with a pleasing variety of matter, though, at the same
time, rashly and unequally intermixing things divine
and things human.&#8221;</p>

<p>This last common-place distinction seems to me,
however, unworthy of Bacon. It should be banished&mdash;utterly
set aside. Things which are divine should
be human, and things which are human, divine; not
as a mixture, &#8220;a medley,&#8221; in the sense of Bacon&#8217;s
words, but an interfusion; for nothing that we
esteem divine can be anything to us but as we make
it <i>ours</i>, <i>i. e.</i> humanise it; and our humanity were a
poor thing but for &#8220;the divinity that stirs within
us.&#8221; We do injury to our own nature&mdash;we miscon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>ceive
our relations to the Creator, to his universe,
and to each other, so long as we separate and studiously
keep wide apart the <i>divine</i> and the <i>human</i>.</p>

<h5>45.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;L</span><span class="smcap">et</span> no man, upon a weak conceit of sobriety or
an ill-applied moderation, think or maintain
that a man can search too far or be too well studied
either in the book of God&#8217;s word or the book of God&#8217;s
works.&#8221; Well advised! But then he goes on to
warn men that they do not &#8220;unwisely mingle or
confound their learnings together:&#8221; mischievous this
contradistinction between God&#8217;s word and God&#8217;s
works; since both, if emanating from him, must be
equally true. And if there be one truth, then, to
borrow his own words in another place, &#8220;the voice
of nature will consent, whether the voice of man do
so or not.&#8221;</p>

<h5>46.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">propos</span> to education&mdash;here is a good illustration:
&#8220;Were it not better for a man in a fair room to
set up one great light or branching candlestick of
lights, than to go about with a rushlight into every
dark corner?&#8221;</p>

<p>And here is another: &#8220;It is one thing to set
forth what ground lieth unmanured, and another to
correct ill husbandry in that which <i>is</i> manured.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<h5>47.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is without all controversy that learning doth
make the minds of men gentle and generous,
amiable, and pliant to government, whereas ignorance
maketh them churlish, thwarting, and mutinous.&#8221;</p>

<h5>48.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;A</span><span class="smcap">n</span> impatience of doubt and an unadvised haste to
assertion without due and mature suspension
of the judgment, is an error in the conduct of the
understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In contemplation, if a man begin with certainties
he shall end in doubts, but if he will be content to
begin with doubts he shall end in certainties.&#8221; Well
said and profoundly true.</p>

<p>This is a celebrated and often-cited passage; an
admitted principle in theory. I wish it were oftener
applied in practice,&mdash;more especially in education.
For it seems to me that in teaching children we
ought not to be perpetually dogmatising. We ought
not to be ever placing before them only the known
and the definite; but to allow the unknown, the
uncertain, the indefinite, to be suggested to their
minds: it would do more for the growth of a truly
religious feeling than all the catechisms of scientific
facts and creeds of theological definitions that
ever were taught in cut and dried question and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
answer. Why should not the young candid mind
be allowed to reflect on the unknown, as such?
on the doubtful, as such&mdash;open to inquiry and
liable to discussion? Why will teachers suppose that
in confessing their own ignorance or admitting uncertainties
they must diminish the respect of their
pupils, or their faith in truth? I should say from my
own experience that the effect is just the reverse.
I remember, when a child, hearing a very celebrated
man profess his ignorance on some particular
subject, and I felt awe-struck&mdash;it gave me a perception
of the infinite,&mdash;as when looking up at the
starry sky. What we unadvisedly cram into a child&#8217;s
mind in the same form it has taken in our own, does
not always healthily or immediately assimilate; it
dissolves away in doubts, or it hardens into prejudice,
instead of mingling with the life as truth ought to
do. It is the early and habitual surrendering of the
mind to authority, which makes it afterwards so
ready for deception of all kinds.</p>

<h5>49.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> speaks of &#8220;legends and narrations of miracles
wrought by martyrs, hermits, monks, which,
though they have had passage for a time by the ignorance
of the people, the superstitious simplicity
of some, and the politic toleration of others, holding
them but as divine poesies; yet after a time they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
grew up to be esteemed but as old wives&#8217; fables, to
the great scandal and detriment of religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very ambiguous, surely. Does he mean that it
was to the great scandal and detriment of religion
that they existed at all? or that they came to be
regarded as old wives&#8217; fables?</p>

<h5>50.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> says, farther on, &#8220;though truth and error are
carefully to be separated, yet rarities and reports
that seem incredible are not to be suppressed
or denied to the memory of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For it is not yet known in what cases and how
far effects attributed to superstition do participate
of natural causes.&#8221;</p>

<h5>51.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;T</span><span class="smcap">o</span> be speculative with another man to the end
to know how to work him or wind him, proceedeth
from a heart that is double and cloven, and
not entire and ingenuous; which, as in friendship, it
is a want of <i>integrity</i>, so towards princes or superiors
it is a want of <i>duty</i>.&#8221; (No occasion, surely, for the
distinction here drawn; inasmuch as the want of
integrity involves the want of <i>every</i> duty.)</p>

<p>Then he speaks of &#8220;the stooping to points of necessity
and convenience and outward basenesses,&#8221; as to
be accounted &#8220;submission to the occasion, not to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
person.&#8221; Vile distinction! an excuse to himself for
his dedication to the King, and his flattery of Carr
and Villiers.</p>

<h5>52.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">ur</span> English Universities are only now beginning
to show some sign (reluctant sign) of submitting
to that re-examination which the great philosopher
recommended two hundred and fifty years ago, when
he says: &#8220;Inasmuch as most of the usages and
orders of the universities were derived from more
obscure times, it is the more requisite they be reexamined&#8221;&mdash;and
more to the same purpose.</p>

<h5>53.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;I</span><span class="smcap">f</span> that great Workmaster (God) had been of a
human disposition, he would have cast the
stars into some pleasant and beautiful works and
orders like the frets in the roofs of houses; whereas,
one can scarce find a posture in square or triangle
or straight line amongst such an infinite number, so
differing an harmony there is between the spirit of
man and the spirit of nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps if our human vision could be removed to
a sufficient distance to contemplate the whole of
what we now see in part, what appears disorder
might appear beautiful order. The stars which now
appear as if flung about at random, would perhaps be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
resolved into some exquisitely beautiful and regular
edifice. The fly on the cornice, &#8220;whose feeble ray
scarce spreads an inch around,&#8221; might as well discuss
the proportions of the Parthenon as we the
true figure and frame of God&#8217;s universe.</p>

<p>I remember seeing, through Lord Rosse&#8217;s telescope,
one of those nebul&aelig; which have hitherto appeared
like small masses of vapour floating about in space.
I saw it composed of thousands upon thousands of
brilliant stars, and the effect to the eye&mdash;to mine at
least&mdash;was as if I had had my hand full of diamonds,
and suddenly unclosing it, and flinging them forth,
they were dispersed as from a centre, in a kind of
partly irregular, partly fan-like form; and I had a
strange feeling of suspense and amazement while
I looked, because they did not change their relative
position, did not fall&mdash;though in act to fall&mdash;but
seemed fixed in the very attitude of being flung forth
into space;&mdash;it was most wondrous and beautiful
to see!</p>

<h5>54.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is pleasant to me to think that Bacon&#8217;s
stupendous intellect believed in the moral progress
of human societies, because it is my own belief,
and one that I would not for worlds resign. I indeed
believe that each human being must here (or hereafter?)
work out his own peculiar moral life: but
also that the whole race has a progressive moral life:
just as in our solar system every individual planet
moves in its own orbit, while the whole system
moves on together; we know not whither, we know
not round what centre&mdash;&#8220;<i>ma pur si muove!</i>&#8221;</p>

<h5>55.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span><span class="smcap">et</span> he says in another place, with equal wit and
sublimity, &#8220;Every obtaining of a desire hath a
<i>show</i> of advancement, as motion in a circle hath a
<i>show</i> of progression.&#8221; Perhaps our movement may
be <i>spiral</i>? and every revolution may bring us nearer
and nearer to some divine centre in which we may
be absorbed at last?</p>

<h5>56.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> refers in this following passage to that theory
of the angelic existences which we see expressed
in ancient symbolic Art, first by variation of
colour only, and later, by variety of expression and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
form. He says,&mdash;&#8220;We find, as far as credit is to
be given to the celestial hierarchy of that supposed
Dionysius, the senator of Athens, that the first place
or degree is given to the Angels of Love, which are
called Seraphim; the second to the Angels of Light,
which are termed Cherubim; and the third, and so
following, to Thrones, Principalities, and the rest
(which are all angels of power and ministry); so as
the angels of knowledge and illumination are placed
before the angels of office and domination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;But the Angels of <span class="smcap">Love</span> are first and over all.
In other words, we have here in due order of precedence,
1. <span class="smcap">Love</span>, 2. <span class="smcap">Knowledge</span>, 3. <span class="smcap">Power</span>,&mdash;the
angelic Trinity, which, in unity, is our idea of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

who in many passages of his book piques himself on

<p>We too often make the vulgar mistake that
undisciplined or overgrown passions are a sign of
strength; they are the signs of immaturity, of
&#8220;enormous childhood.&#8221;&mdash;And the distinction (above)
is well drawn and true. The real savage is that
monstrous, malignant, abject thing, generated out of
the rottenness and ferment of civilisation. And yet
extremes meet: I remember seeing on the shores of
Lake Huron some Indians of a distant tribe of Chippawas,
who in appearance were just like those
fearful abortions of humanity which crawl out of
the darkness, filth, and ignorance of our great towns,
just so miserable, so stupid, so cruel,&mdash;only, perhaps,
less <i>wicked</i>.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smcap">hateaubriand</span> was always comparing himself

this he was altogether mistaken.</p>

<p>I once counted among my friends an elderly lady
of high rank, who had spent the whole of a long life
in intimacy with royal and princely personages. In
three different courts she had filled offices of trust
and offices of dignity. In referring to her experience
she never either moralised or generalised; but her
scorn of &#8220;ces b&ecirc;tes &agrave; couronne,&#8221; was habitually
expressed with just such a cool epigrammatic bluntness

point &agrave; mes ennemis je ne leur fais aucun mal; je
suis <i>rancunier</i> et ne suis point <i>vindicatif</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very nice and true distinction in point of feeling
and character, yet hardly to be expressed in
English. We always attach the idea of malignity
to the word <i>rancour</i>, whereas the French words
<i>rancune</i>, <i>rancunier</i>, express the relentless without
the vengeful or malignant spirit.</p>

<p>Such characters make me turn pale, as I have done
at sight of a tomb in which an offending wretch had
been buried alive. There is in them always something
acute and deep and indomitable in the internal
and exciting emotion; slow, scrupulous, and timid
in the external demonstration. Cordelia is such a
character.</p>

<h4>BISHOP CUMBERLAND.</h4>

<h5>BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH IN 1691.</h5>

<h5>71.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smcap">ishop Cumberland</span> founds the law of God,
as revealed in the Scriptures, upon the general
law of nature. He does not attempt to found the
laws of nature upon the Bible. &#8220;We believe,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;in the truth of Scripture, because it promotes
and illustrates the fundamental laws of nature in the
government of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then does the Bishop mean here that the Bible is
not the <span class="smcap">WORD</span> nor the <span class="smcap">WILL</span> of God, but the exposition
of the <span class="smcap">WORD</span> and the record of the <span class="smcap">WILL</span>, so far
as either could be rendered communicable to human
comprehension through the medium of human language
and intelligence?</p>

<p>There is a striking passage in Bunsen&#8217;s Hippolytus,
which may be considered with reference to this
opinion of the Bishop.</p>

<p>He (Bunsen) says, that &#8220;what relates the history<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
of &#8216;the word of God&#8217; in his humanity, and in this
world, and what records its teachings, and warnings,
and promises (that is, the Bible?) was mistaken
for &#8216;the word of God&#8217; itself, in its proper sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Does he mean that we deem erroneously the collection
of writings we call the Bible to be &#8220;the word
of God;&#8221; whereas, in fact, it is &#8220;the history, the
record of the word of God?&#8221; that is, of all that God
has spoken to man&mdash;in various revelations&mdash;through
human life&mdash;by human deeds?&mdash;because this is
surely a most important and momentous distinction.</p>

<h5>72.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">ccording</span> to Bishop Cumberland, <i>benevolence</i>, in
its large sense,&mdash;that is, a regard for all <span class="smcap">GOOD</span>,
universal and particular,&mdash;is the primary law of
nature; and <i>justice</i> is one form, and a secondary
form, of this law: a moral virtue, not a law of nature,&mdash;if
I understand his meaning rightly.</p>

<p>Then which would he place <i>highest</i>, the law of
nature or the moral law?</p>

<p>If you place them in contradistinction, then are
we to conclude that the law of nature <i>precedes</i> the
moral law, but that the moral law <i>supersedes</i> the law
of nature? Yet no law of nature (as I understand
the word) <i>can</i> be superseded, though the moral law
may be based upon it, and in that sense may be
<i>above</i> it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<h5>73.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> this following passage the Bishop seems to have
anticipated what in more modern times has
been called the &#8220;<i>greatest happiness principle</i>.&#8221; He
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The good of all rational beings is a complex
whole, being nothing but the aggregate of good enjoyed
by each.&#8221; &#8220;We can only act in our proper
spheres, labouring to do good, but this labour will
be fruitless, or rather mischievous, if we do not keep
in mind the higher gradations which terminate in
universal benevolence. Thus, no man must seek his
own pleasure or advantage otherwise than as his
family permits; or provide for his family to the
detriment of his country; or promote the good of his
country at the expense of mankind; or serve mankind,
if it were possible, without regard to the
majesty of God.&#8221;</p>

<h5>74.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smcap">aley</span> deems the recognition of a future state so
essential that he even makes the definition of
virtue to consist in this, that it is good performed for
the sake of everlasting happiness. That is to say, he
makes it a sort of bargain between God and man, a
contract, or a covenant, instead of that obedience to
a primal law, from which if we stray in will, we do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
so at the necessary expense of our happiness. Bishop
Cumberland has no reference to this doctrine of
Paley&#8217;s;&mdash;seems, indeed, to set it aside altogether,
as contrary to the essence of virtue.</p>

<p class="tb">On the whole, this good Bishop appears to have
treated ethics not as an ecclesiastic, but as Bacon
treated natural philosophy;&mdash;the pervading spirit
is the perpetual appeal to experience, and not to
authority.</p>

<h4>COMTE&#8217;S PHILOSOPHY.</h4>

<h5>1852.</h5>

<h5>75.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smcap">omte</span> makes out three elements of progress,
&#8220;les philosophes, les prol&eacute;taires, et les femmes;&#8221;&mdash;types
of intellect, material activity, and sentiment.</p>

<p>From Woman, he says, is to proceed the preponderance
of the social duties and affections over egotism
and ambition. (La pr&eacute;pond&eacute;rance de la sociabilit&eacute;
sur la personalit&eacute;.) He adds:&mdash;&#8220;Ce sexe est certainement
sup&eacute;rieure au notre quant &agrave; l&#8217;attribut le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
plus fondamentale de l&#8217;esp&egrave;ce humaine, la tendence
de faire pr&eacute;valoir la <i>sociabilit&eacute;</i> sur la<i> personalit&eacute;</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h5>76.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;S</span><span class="smcap">&#8217;il</span> ne fallait <i>qu&#8217;aimer</i> comme dans l&#8217;Utopie
Chr&eacute;tienne, sur une vie future affranchie de
toute &eacute;go&iuml;ste necessit&eacute; mat&eacute;rielle, la femme r&eacute;gnerait;
mais il faut surtout <i>agir</i> et <i>penser</i> pour combattre
contre les rigueurs de notre vraie destin&eacute;e: d&egrave;s-lors
l&#8217;homme doit commander malgr&eacute; sa moindre moralit&eacute;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Malgr&eacute;?&#8221; Sometimes man commands <i>because</i> of
the &#8220;moindre moralit&eacute;:&#8221;&mdash;it spares much time in
scruples.</p>

<h5>78.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;L</span><span class="smcap">a</span> Force, proprement dite, c&#8217;est ce qui r&eacute;git les
actes, sans r&eacute;gler les volont&eacute;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herein lies a distinction between Force and
Power; for Power, properly so called, does both.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<h5>79.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> insists throughout on the predominance of <i>sociabilit&eacute;</i>
over <i>personalit&eacute;</i>&mdash;and what is that but
the Christian law philosophised? and again, &#8220;Il n&#8217;y
a de directement morale dans notre nature que
l&#8217;amour.&#8221; Where did he get this, if not in the
Epistle of St. John?</p>

<p>&#8220;Celui qui se croirait ind&eacute;pendant des autres dans
ses affections, ses pens&eacute;es, ou ses actes, ne pourrait
m&ecirc;me formuler un tel blasph&egrave;me sans une contradiction
imm&eacute;diate&mdash;puisque son langage m&ecirc;me ne lui
appartient pas.&#8221;</p>

<h5>80.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> says that if the women regret the age of
chivalry, it is not for the external homage then
paid to them, but because &#8220;l&#8217;&eacute;l&eacute;ment le plus moral
de l&#8217;humanit&eacute;&#8221; (woman, to wit), &#8220;doit pr&eacute;f&eacute;rer &agrave; tout
autre le seul r&eacute;gime qui &eacute;rigea directement en principe
la pr&eacute;ponderance de la morale sur la politique.
Si elles regrettent leur douce influence ant&eacute;rieure,
c&#8217;est surtout comme s&#8217;effa&ccedil;ant aujourd&#8217;hui sous un
grossier &eacute;go&iuml;sme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leurs v&oelig;ux spontan&eacute;s seconderont toujours les
efforts directes des philosophes et des prol&eacute;taires
pour transformer enfin les d&eacute;bats politiques en
transactions sociales en faisant pr&eacute;valoir les <i>d&eacute;voirs</i>
sur les <i>droits</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>This is admirable; for we are all inclined to think
more about our <i>rights</i> (and our wrongs too) than
about our <i>duties</i>.</p>

<h5>81.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;S</span><span class="smcap">i</span> donc aimer nous satisfait mieux que d&#8217;&ecirc;tre
aim&eacute;, cela constate la sup&eacute;riorit&eacute; naturelle des
affections d&eacute;sint&eacute;ress&eacute;es.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meaning&mdash;what is true&mdash;that the love we bear to
another, much more fills the whole soul and is more
a possession of an actuating principle, than the love
of another for us:&mdash;but both are necessary to the
complement of our moral life. The first is as the
air we breathe; the last is as our daily bread.</p>

<h5>82.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> says that the only true and firm friendship is
that between man and woman, because it is the
only affection &#8220;exempte de toute concurrence actuelle
ou possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this I am inclined to agree with him, and to
regret that our conventional morality or immorality,
and the too early severance of the two sexes in education,
place men and women in such a relation to
each other, socially, as to render such friendships
difficult and rare.</p>

<h5>83.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;E</span><span class="smcap">n</span> v&eacute;rit&eacute; l&#8217;amour ne saurait &ecirc;tre profond, s&#8217;il
n&#8217;est pas pur.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>Christianity, he says, &#8220;a favoris&eacute; l&#8217;essor de la
v&eacute;ritable passion, tandisque le polyth&eacute;isme consacrait
surtout les app&eacute;tits.&#8221;</p>

<p>He is speaking here as teacher, philosopher, and
legislator, not as poet or sentimentalist. Perhaps it
will come to be recognised sooner or later, that what
people are pleased to call the <i>romance</i> of life is
founded on the deepest and most immutable laws of
our being, and that any system of ecclesiastical
polity, or civil legislation, or moral philosophy, which
takes no account of the primal instincts and affections,
which are the springs of life and on which
God made the continuation of his world to depend,
<i>must</i> of necessity fail.</p>

<p>I have just read a volume of Psychological Essays
by one of the most celebrated of living surgeons, and
closed the book with a feeling of amazement: a long
life spent in physiological experiences, dissecting dead
bodies, and mending broken bones, has then led him,
at last, to some of the most obvious, most commonly
known facts in mental philosophy? So some of our
profound politicians, after a long life spent in governing
and reforming men, may arrive, <i>at last</i>, at some
of the commonest facts in social morals.</p>

<h5>84.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">e</span> contends for the indissolubility of marriage, and
against divorce; and he thinks that education<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
should be in the hands of women to the age of ten or
twelve, &#8220;Afin que le c&oelig;ur y pr&eacute;vale toujours sur
l&#8217;esprit:&#8221; all very excellent principles, but supposing
a <i>hypothetical</i> social and moral state, from which we
are as yet far removed. What he says, however, of
the indissolubility of the marriage bond is so beautiful
and eloquent, and so in accordance with my own
moral theories, that I cannot help extracting it from
a mass of heavy and sometimes unintelligible matter.
He begins by laying it down as a principle that the
&#8220;am&eacute;lioration morale de l&#8217;homme constitue la principale
mission de la femme,&#8221; and that &#8220;une telle destination
indique aussit&ocirc;t que le lien conjugal doit
&ecirc;tre unique et indissoluble, afin que les relations
domestiques puissent acqu&eacute;rir la pl&eacute;nitude et la
fixit&eacute; qu&#8217;exige leur efficacit&eacute; morale.&#8221; This, however,
supposes the holiest and completest of all bonds
to be sealed on terms of equality, not that the latter
end of a man&#8217;s life, <i>la vie us&eacute;e et la jeunesse &eacute;puis&eacute;e</i>,
are to be tacked on to the beginning of a woman&#8217;s
fresh and innocent existence; for then influences are
reversed, and instead of the amelioration of the masculine,
we have the demoralisation of the feminine,
nature. He supposes the possibility of circumstances
which demand a personal separation, but even
then <i>sans permettre un nouveau mariage</i>. In such
a case his religion imposes on the innocent victim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
(whether man or woman) &#8220;une chastet&eacute; compatible
d&#8217;ailleurs avec la plus profonde tendresse. Si cette
condition lui semble rigoureuse, il doit l&#8217;accepter,
d&#8217;abord, en vue de l&#8217;ordre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral; puis, comme une
juste cons&eacute;quence de son erreur primitive.&#8221;</p>

<p>There would be much to say upon all this, if it
were worth while to discuss a theory which it is not
possible to reduce to general practice. We cannot
imagine the possibility of a second marriage where
the first, though perhaps unhappy or early ruptured,
has been, not a personal relation only, but an interfusion
of our moral being,&mdash;of the deepest impulses of
life&mdash;with those of another; <i>these</i> we cannot have a
second time to surrender to a second object;&mdash;but
this might be left to Nature and her holy instincts to
settle. However, he goes on in a strain of eloquence
and dignity, quite unusual with him, to this effect:&mdash;&#8220;Ce

que les liens intimes peuvent acqu&eacute;rir la
consistance et la pl&eacute;nitude indispensable &agrave; leur efficacit&eacute;

&ecirc;tres aussi complexes et aussi divers que l&#8217;homme et
la femme, ce n&#8217;est pas trop de toute la vie pour se
bien conna&icirc;tre et s&#8217;aimer dignement. Loin de taxer
d&#8217;illusion la haute id&eacute;e que deux vrais &eacute;poux se<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>

toujours attribu&eacute;e &agrave; l&#8217;appr&eacute;ciation plus profonde que
procure seule une pleine intimit&eacute;, que d&#8217;ailleurs d&eacute;veloppe
des qualit&eacute;s inconnues aux indiff&eacute;rents. On
doit m&ecirc;me regarder comme tr&egrave;s-honorable pour
notre esp&egrave;ce, cette grande estime que ses membres
s&#8217;inspirent mutuellement quand ils s&#8217;&eacute;tudient beaucoup.
<i>Car la haine et l&#8217;indiff&eacute;rence m&eacute;riteraient
seules le reproche d&#8217;aveuglement qu&#8217;une appr&eacute;ciation
superficielle applique &agrave; l&#8217;amour.</i> Il faut donc juger
pleinement conforme &agrave; la nature humaine l&#8217;institution
qui prolonge au-del&agrave; du tombeau l&#8217;indentification de
deux dignes &eacute;poux.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lays down as one of the primal instincts of
human kind &#8220;<i>l&#8217;homme doit nourrir la femme</i>.&#8221; This
may have been, as he says, a universal <i>instinct</i>;
perhaps it ought to be one of our social ordinations;
perhaps it may be so at some future time;
but we know that it is not a present fact; that the
woman must in many cases maintain herself or
perish, and she asks nothing more than to be allowed
to do so.</p>

<p>However, I agree with Comte that the position
of a woman, enriched and independent by her own
labour, is anomalous and seldom happy. It is a
remark I have heard somewhere, and it appears to
me true, that there exists no being so hard, so
keen, so calculating, so unscrupulous, so merciless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
in money matters as the wife of a Parisian shopkeeper,
where she holds the purse and manages the
concern, as is generally the case.</p>

<h5>85.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">ere</span> is a passage wherein he attacks that egotism
which with many good people enters so largely
into the notion of another world:&mdash;which Paley inculcated,
and which Coleridge ridiculed, when he
spoke of &#8220;<i>this</i> worldliness,&#8221; and the &#8220;<i>other</i> worldliness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;La sagesse sacerdotale, digne organe de l&#8217;instinct
public, y avait intimement rattach&eacute; les principales
obligations sociales &agrave; titre de condition indispensable

ainsi &agrave; tous les sacrifices ne pouvait jamais
permettre une affection pleinement d&eacute;sinteress&eacute;e.&#8221;</p>

<p>This perpetual iteration of a system of future
reward and punishment, as a principle of our religion
and a motive of action, has in some sort demoralised
Christianity; especially in minds where love is not a
chief element, and which do not love Christ for his
love&#8217;s sake, but for his power&#8217;s sake, and because
judgment and punishment are supposed to be in his
hand.</p>

<h5>86.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smcap">utting</span> the test of revelation out of the question,
and dealing with the philosopher philosophically,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
the best refutation of Comte&#8217;s system is contained in
the following criticism: it seems to me final.</p>

<p>&#8220;In limiting religion to the relations in which we
stand to each other, and towards <i>Humanity</i>, Comte
omits one very important consideration. Even upon
his own showing, this <i>Humanity</i> can only be the
<i>supreme being</i> of <i>our</i> planet, it cannot be the <i>Supreme
Being</i> of the Universe. Now, although in this our
terrestrial sojourn, all we can distinctly know must
be limited to the sphere of our planet; yet, standing
on this ball and looking forth into infinitude, we
know that it is but an atom of the infinitude, and
that the humanity we worship <i>here</i>, cannot extend
its dominion <i>there</i>. If our relations to humanity
may be systematised into a cultus, and made a religion
as they have formerly been made a morality,
and if the whole of our practical priesthood be
limited to this religion, there will, nevertheless
remain for us, outlying this terrestrial sphere,&mdash;the
sphere of the infinite, in which our thoughts must
wander, and our emotions will follow our thoughts;
so that besides the religion of humanity there must
ever be a religion of the Universe. Or, to bring
this conception within ordinary language, there must
ever remain the old distinctions between <i>religion</i> and
<i>morality</i>, our relations to God, and our relations
towards man. The only difference being, that in
the <i>old</i> theology moral precepts were inculcated with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
a view to a celestial habitat; in the <i>new</i>, the moral
precepts are inculcated with a view to the general
progress of the race.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Westminster Review.</i></p>

<p class="tb">In fact the doctrine of the non-plurality of worlds
as recently set forth by an eminent professor and
D. D. would exactly harmonise with Comte&#8217;s &#8220;Culte
du Positif,&#8221; as not merely limiting our sympathies
to this one form of intellectual being, but our religious
notions to this one habitable orb.</p>

<p>But to those who take other views, the argument
above contains the <i>philosophical</i> objection to Comte&#8217;s
<i>system</i>, as such; and I repeat, that it seems to me unanswerable;
but there are excellent things in his
theory, notwithstanding;&mdash;things that make us pause
and think. In some parts it is like Christianity with
Christ, as a <i>personalit&eacute;</i>, omitted. For Christ the
humanised divine, he substitutes an abstract deified
humanity. 1854.</p>

<h4>GOETHE.</h4>

<h5>(DICHTUNG UND WAHRHEIT.)</h5>

<h5>87.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;A</span><span class="smcap">s</span> a man embraces the determination to become
a soldier and go to the wars, bravely resolved
to bear dangers, and difficulties, and wounds, and
death itself, but at the same time never anticipating
the particular form in which those evils may surprise
us in an extremely unpleasant manner;&mdash;just so we
rush into authorship!&#8221;</p>

<h5>88.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="smcap">oethe</span> says of Lavater, &#8220;that the conception of
humanity which had been formed in himself,
and in his own humanity, was so akin to the living
image of Christ, that it was impossible for him to
conceive how a man could live and breathe without
being a Christian. He had, so to speak, a physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
affinity with Christianity; it was to him a necessity,
not only morally, but from organisation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavater&#8217;s individual feeling was, perhaps, but an
anticipation of that which may become general, universal.
As we rise in the scale of being, as we
become more gentle, spiritualised, refined, and intelligent,
will not our &#8220;physical affinity&#8221; with the
religion of Christ become more and more apparent,
till it is less a doctrine than a principle of life? So
its Divine Author knew, who prepared it for us, and
is preparing and moulding us through progressive
improvement to comprehend and receive it.</p>

<h5>89.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="smcap">oethe</span> speaks of &#8220;polishing up life with the
varnish of fiction;&#8221; the artistic turn of the man&#8217;s
mind showed itself in this love of creating an effect
in his own eyes and in the eyes of others. But what
can fiction&mdash;what can poetry do for life, but present
some one or two out of the multitudinous aspects of
that grand, beautiful, terrible, and infinite mystery?
or by <i>life</i>, does he mean here the mere external forms
of society?&mdash;for it is not clear.</p>

<h4>HAZLITT&#8217;S &#8220;LIBER AMORIS.&#8221;</h4>

<h5>1827.</h5>

<h5>90.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">s</span> love, like faith, ennobled through its own depth
and fervour and sincerity? or is it ennobled
through the nobility, and degraded through the
degradation of its object? Is it with love as with
worship? Is it a <i>religion</i>, and holy when the object
is pure and good? Is it a <i>superstition</i>, and unholy
when the object is impure and unworthy?</p>

<p class="tb">Of all the histories I have read of the aberrations
of human passion, nothing ever so struck me with a
sort of amazed and painful pity as Hazlitt&#8217;s &#8220;Liber
Amoris.&#8221; The man was in love with a servant girl,
who in the eyes of others possessed no particular
charms of mind or person, yet did the mighty love of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
this strong, masculine, and gifted being, lift her into
a sort of goddess-ship; and make his idolatry in its
intense earnestness and reality assume something of
the sublimity of an act of faith, and in its expression
take a flight equal to anything that poetry or fiction
have left us. It was all so terribly real, he sued with
such a vehemence, he suffered with such resistance,
that the powerful intellect reeled, tempest-tost, and
might have foundered but for the gift of expression.
He might have said like Tasso&mdash;like Goethe rather&mdash;&#8220;Gab
mir ein Gott zu sagen was ich leide!&#8221;
And this faculty of utterance, eloquent utterance,
was perhaps the only thing which saved life, or reason,
or both. In such moods of passion, the poor uneducated
man, dumb in the midst of the strife and the
storm, unable to comprehend his intolerable pain or
make it comprehended, throws himself in a blind
fury on the cause of his torture, or hangs himself in
his neckcloth.</p>

<h5>91.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">azlitt</span> takes up his pen, dips it in fire and thus
he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfect love has this advantage in it, that it leaves
the possessor of it nothing farther to desire. There
is one object (at least), in which the soul finds absolute
content;&mdash;for which it seeks to live or dares to
die. The heart has, as it were, filled up the moulds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
of the imagination; the truth of passion keeps pace
with, and outvies, the extravagance of mere language.
There are no words so fine, no flattery so soft, that
there is not a sentiment beyond them that it is impossible
to express, at the bottom of the heart where
true love is. What idle sounds the common phrases
<i>adorable creature</i>, <i>divinity</i>, <i>angel</i>, are! What a proud
reflection it is to have a feeling answering to all
these, rooted in the breast, unalterable, unutterable,
to which all other feelings are light and vain! Perfect
love reposes on the object of its choice, like the
halcyon on the wave, and the air of heaven is around
it!&#8221;</p>

<h5>92.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;S</span><span class="smcap">he</span> stood (while I pleaded my cause before her
with all the earnestness and fondness in the
world) with the tears trickling from her eye-lashes,
her head drooping, her attitude fixed, with the finest
expression that ever was seen of mixed regret, pity,
and stubborn resolution, but without speaking a word&mdash;without
altering a feature. <i>It was like a petrifaction
of a human face in the softest moment of passion.</i>&#8221;</p>

<h5>93.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;S</span><span class="smcap">hall</span> I not love her,&#8221; he exclaims, &#8220;for herself
alone, in spite of fickleness and folly? to love
her for her regard for me, is not to love her but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
myself. She has robbed me of herself, shall she also
rob me of my love of her? did I not live on her
smile? is it less sweet because it is withdrawn from
me? Did I not adore her every grace? and does she
bend less enchantingly because she has turned from
me to another? Is my love then in the power of
fortune or of her caprice? No, I will have it lasting
as it is pure; and I will make a goddess of her, and
build a temple to her in my heart, and worship her
on indestructible altars, and raise statues to her, and
my homage shall be unblemished as her unrivalled
symmetry of form. And when that fails, the memory
of it shall survive, and my bosom shall be proof to
scorn as hers has been to pity; and I will pursue her
with an unrelenting love, and sue to be her slave and
tend her steps without notice, and without reward;
and serve her living, and mourn for her when dead;
and thus my love will have shown itself superior to
her hate, and I shall triumph and then die. This is
my idea of the only true and heroic love, and such is
mine for her.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">Hazlitt, when he wrote all this, seemed to himself
full of high and calm resolve. The hand did not
fail, the pen did not stagger over the paper in a
formless scrawl, yet the brain was reeling like a
tower in an earthquake. &#8220;Passion,&#8221; as it has been
well said, &#8220;when in a state of solemn and omni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>potent
vehemence, always appears to be calmness to
him whom it domineers;&#8221; not unfrequently to others
also, as the tide at its highest flood looks tranquil,
and &#8220;neither way inclines.&#8221;</p>

<h4>THE NIGHTINGALE.</h4>

<h5>94.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="smcap">eading</span> the Life and Letters of Francis Horner,
in the midst of a correspondence about Statistics
and Bullion, and Political Economy, and the Balance
of Parties, I came upon the following exquisite passage
in a letter to his friend Mrs. Spencer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was amused by your interrogatory to me about
the Nightingale&#8217;s note. You meant to put me in a
dilemma with my politics on one side and my gallantry
on the other. Of course you consider it as a
plaintive note, and you were in hopes that no idolater
of Charles Fox would venture to agree with that
opinion. In this difficulty I must make the best
escape I can by saying, that it seems to me neither
cheerful nor melancholy,&mdash;but always according to
the circumstances in which you hear it, the scenery,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
your own temper of mind, and so on. I settled it so
with myself early in this month, when I heard them
every night and all day long at Wells. In daylight,
when all the other birds are in active concert, the
Nightingale only strikes you as the most active, emulous,
and successful of the whole band. At night,
especially if it is a calm one, with light enough to
give you a wide indistinct view, the solitary music of
this bird takes quite another character, from all the
associations of the scene, from the languor one feels
at the close of the day, and from the stillness of spirits
and elevation of mind which comes upon one when
walking out at that time. But it is not always so&mdash;different
circumstances will vary in every possible
way the effect. Will the Nightingale&#8217;s note sound
alike to the man who is going on an adventure to
meet his mistress (supposing he heeds it at all), and
when he loiters along upon his return? The last
time I heard the Nightingale it was an experiment
of another sort. It was after a thunderstorm
in a mild night, while there was silent
lightning opening every few minutes, first on one
side of the heavens then on the other. The careless
little fellow was piping away in the midst of
all this terror. To <i>me</i>, there was no melancholy in
his note, but a sort of sublimity; yet it was the same
song which I had heard in the morning, and which
then seemed nothing but bustle.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>And in the same spirit Portia moralises:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The nightingale, if she should sing by day,</span>
<span class="i0">When every goose is cackling, would be thought</span>
<span class="i0">No better a musician than the wren.</span>
<span class="i0">How many things by season, seasoned are</span>
<span class="i0">To their right praise and true perfection!</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>Nor will Coleridge allow the song of the nightingale
to be always plaintive,&mdash;&#8220;most musical, most
<i>melancholy</i>;&#8221; he defies the epithet though it be
Milton&#8217;s.</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&#8217;Tis the <i>merry</i> nightingale,</span>
<span class="i0">That crowds and hurries and precipitates</span>
<span class="i0">With thick fast warble his delicious notes,</span>
<span class="i0">As he were fearful that an April night</span>
<span class="i0">Would be too short for him to utter forth</span>
<span class="i0">His love-chaunt, and disburthen his full soul</span>
<span class="i0">Of all its music.</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>As a poetical commentary on these beautiful
passages, every reader of Joanna Baillie will remember
the night scene in De Montfort, where the cry of
the Owl suggests such different feelings and associations
to the two men who listen to it, under such
different circumstances. To De Montfort it is the
screech-owl, foreboding death and horror,&mdash;and he
stands and shudders at the &#8220;instinctive wailing.&#8221;
To Rezenvelt it is the sound which recalls his boyish
days, when he merrily mimicked the night-bird till it
returned him cry for cry,&mdash;and he pauses to listen
with a fanciful delight.</p>

<h4>THACKERAY&#8217;S LECTURES ON THE ENGLISH HUMORISTS</h4>

<h5>(1833.)</h5>

<h5>95.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> <span class="smcap">lecture</span> should not read like an essay; and,
therefore, it surprises me that these lectures so
carefully prepared, so skilfully adapted to meet the
requirements of oral delivery, should be such agreeable
reading. As <i>lectures</i>, they wanted only a little
more point, and emphasis and animation on the part
of the speaker: as <i>essays</i>, they atone in eloquence
and earnestness for what they want in finish and
purity of style.</p>

<p>Genius and sunshine have this in common that
they are the two most precious gifts of heaven to
earth, and are dispensed equally to the just and the
unjust. What struck me most in these lectures, when
I heard them, (and it strikes me now in turning over
the written pages,) is this: we deal here with writers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
and artists, yet the purpose, from beginning to end,
is not artistic nor critical, but moral. Thackeray
tells us himself that he has not assembled his hearers
to bring them better acquainted with the writings of
these writers, or to illustrate the wit of these wits,
or to enhance the humour of these humourists;&mdash;no;
but to deal justice on the men as <i>men</i>&mdash;to tell
us how <i>they</i> lived, and loved, suffered and made
suffer, who still have power to pain or to please;
to settle <i>their</i> claims to our praise or blame, our
love or hate, whose right to fame was settled long
ago, and remains undisputed. This is his purpose.
Thus then he has laid down and acted on the principle
that &#8220;morals have something to do with art;&#8221;
that there is a moral account to be settled with
men of genius; that the power and the right remains
with us to do justice on those who being
dead yet rule our spirits from their urns; to try
them by a standard which perhaps neither themselves,
nor those around them, would have admitted.
Did Swift when he bullied men, lampooned women,
trampled over decency and humanity, flung round
him filth and fire, did he anticipate the time when
before a company of intellectual men, and thinking,
feeling women, in both hemispheres, he should be
called up to judgment, hands bound, tongue-tied?
Where be now his gibes? and where his terrors?
Thackeray turns him forth, a spectacle, a lesson, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
warning; probes the lacerated self-love, holds up to
scorn, or pity more intolerable, the miserable egotism,
the half-distempered brain. O Stella! O
Vanessa! are you not avenged?</p>

<p>Then Sterne&mdash;how he takes to pieces his feigned
originality, his feigned benevolence, his feigned misanthropy&mdash;all
feigned!&mdash;the licentious parson, the
trader in sentiment, the fashionable lion of his day,
the man without a heart for those who loved him,
without a conscience for those who trusted him! yet
the same man who gave us the pathos of &#8220;Le Fevre,&#8221;
and the humours of &#8220;Uncle Toby!&#8221; Sad is it? ungrateful
is it? ungracious is it?&mdash;well, it cannot be
helped; you cannot stifle the conscience of humanity.
You might as well exclaim against any natural result
of any natural law. Fancy a hundred years
hence some brave, honest, human-hearted Thackeray
standing up to discourse before our great-great-grandchildren
in the same spirit, with the same
stern truth, on the wits, and the poets and the
artists of the present time! Hard is your fate,
O ye men and women of genius! very hard and
pitiful, if ye must be subjected to the scalpel of
such a dissector! You, gifted sinner, whoever you
may be, walking among us now in all the impunity
of conventional forbearance, dealing in oracles and
sentimentalisms, performing great things, teaching
good things, you are set up as one of the lights of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
world:&mdash;Lo! another time comes; the torch is taken
out of your hand, and held up to your face. What!
is it a mask, and not a face? &#8220;Off, off ye lendings!&#8221;
O God! how much wiser, as well as better, not to
study how to <i>seem</i>, but how to <i>be</i>! How much
wiser and better, not to have to shudder before
the truth as it oozes out from a thousand unguessed,
unguarded apertures, staining your lawn or your
ermine; not to have to tremble at the thought of
that future Thackeray, who &#8220;shall pluck out the
heart of your mystery,&#8221; and shall anatomise you, and
deliver lectures upon you, to illustrate the standard
of morals and manners in Queen Victoria&#8217;s reign!</p>

<p>In these lectures, some fine and feeling and discriminative
passages on character, make amends for
certain offences and inconsistencies in the novels; I
mean especially in regard to the female portraits. No
woman resents his Rebecca&mdash;inimitable Becky!&mdash;no
woman but feels and acknowledges with a shiver
the completeness of that wonderful and finished artistic
creation; but every woman resents the selfish
inane Amelia, and would be inclined to quote and
to apply the author&#8217;s own words when speaking of
&#8216;Tom Jones:&#8217;&mdash;&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I think Amelia a
virtuous character. I can&#8217;t say but I think Mr.
Thackeray&#8217;s evident liking and admiration for his
Amelia shows that the great humourist&#8217;s moral sense
was blunted by his life, and that here in art and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
ethics there is a great error. If it be right to have
a heroine whom we are to admire, let us take care at
least that she is admirable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laura, in &#8216;Pendennis,&#8217; is a yet more fatal mistake.
She is drawn with every generous feeling, every good
gift. We do not complain that she loves that poor
creature Pendennis, for she loved him in her childhood.
She grew up with that love in her heart; it
came between her and the perception of his faults; it
is a necessity indivisible from her nature. Hallowed,
through its constancy, therein alone would lie its best
excuse, its beauty and its truth. But Laura, faithless
to that first affection; Laura, waked up to the
appreciation of a far more manly and noble nature,
in love with Warrington, and then going back to
Pendennis, and marrying <i>him</i>! Such infirmity might
be true of some women, but not of such a woman
as Laura; we resent the inconsistency, the indelicacy
of the portrait.</p>

<p>And then Lady Castlewood,&mdash;so evidently a
favourite of the author, what shall we say of her?
The virtuous woman, <i>par excellence</i>, who &#8220;never
sins and never forgives,&#8221; who never resents, nor
relents, nor repents; the mother, who is the rival of
her daughter; the mother, who for years is the <i>confidante</i>
of a man&#8217;s delirious passion for her own child,
and then consoles him by marrying him herself! O
Mr. Thackeray! this will never do! such women <i>may</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
exist, but to hold them up as examples of excellence,
and fit objects of our best sympathies, is a fault, and
proves a low standard in ethics and in art. &#8220;When an
author presents to us a heroine whom we are called
upon to admire, let him at least take care that she is
admirable.&#8221; If in these, and in some other instances,
Thackeray has given us cause of offence, in the
lectures we may thank him for some amends: he has
shown us what he conceives true womanhood and
true manliness ought to be; so with this expression
of gratitude, and a far deeper debt of gratitude left
unexpressed, I close his book, and say, good night!</p>

<h4><span class="oldtype">Notes on Art.</span></h4>

<h5>96.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smcap">ometimes</span>, in thoughtful moments, I am struck
by those beautiful analogies between things
apparently dissimilar&mdash;those awful approximations
between things apparently far asunder&mdash;which many
people would call fanciful and imaginary, but they
seem to bring all God&#8217;s creation, spiritual and material,
into one comprehensive whole; they give me,
thus associated, a glimpse, a perception of that over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>whelming
unity which we call the universe, the
multitudinous <span class="smcap">ONE</span>.</p>

<p>Thus the principle of the highest ideal in art,
as conceived by the Greeks, and unsurpassed in its
purity and beauty, lay in considering well the characteristics
which distinguish the <i>human</i> form from
the brute form; and then, in rendering the human
form, the first aim was to soften down, or, if possible,
throw out wholly, those characteristics which
belong to the brute nature, or are common to the
brute and the man; and the next, to bring into prominence
and even enlarge the proportions of those
manifestations of forms which distinguish humanity;
till, at last, the <i>human</i> merged into the <i>divine</i>, and
the God in look, in limb, in feature, stood revealed.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose this broad principle which the
Greeks applied to form, ethically carried out, and
made the basis of all education&mdash;the training of men
as a race. Suppose we started with the general
axiom that all propensities which we have in common
with the lower animals are to be kept subordinate,
and so far as is consistent with the truth of nature
refined away; and that all the qualities which elevate,
all the aspirations which ally us with the spiritual, are
to be cultivated and rendered more and more prominent,
till at last the human being, in faculties as well
as form, approaches the God-like&mdash;I only say&mdash;suppose?&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Again: it has been said of natural philosophy (Zoology)
that in order to make any real progress in the
science, as such, we must more and more disregard
<i>differences</i>, and more and more attend to the obscured
but essential conditions which are revealed in <i>resemblances</i>,
in the constant and similar relations of primitive
structure. Now if the same principle were
carried out in theology, in morals, in art, as well as
in science, should we not come nearer to the essential
truth in <i>all</i>?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> is an instinctive sense of propriety and
reality in every mind; and it is not true, as
some great authority has said, that in art we are
satisfied with contemplating the work without thinking
of the artist. On the contrary, the artist himself
is one great object in the work. It is as embodying
the energies and excellences of the human mind, as
exhibiting the efforts of genius, as symbolising high
feeling, that we most value the creations of art;
without design the representations of art are merely
fantastical, and without the thought of a design act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>ing
upon fixed principles in accordance with a high
standard of goodness and truth, half the charm of
design is lost.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;A</span><span class="smcap">rt</span>, used collectively for painting, sculpture,
architecture, and music, is the mediatress
between, and reconciler of, nature and man. It is,
therefore, the power of humanising nature, of infusing
the thoughts and passions of man into everything
which is the object of his contemplation. Colour,
form, motion, sound, are the elements which it
combines, and it stamps them into unity in the
mould of a <i>moral</i> idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is Coleridge&#8217;s definition:&mdash;Art then is nature,
<i>humanised</i>; and in proportion as humanity is elevated
by the interfusion into our life of noble aims and pure
affections will art be spiritualised and moralised.</p>

<p>Goethe observes that there is no patriotic art and
no patriotic science&mdash;that both are universal.</p>

<p>There is, however, <i>national</i> art, but not <i>national</i>
science: we say &#8220;national art,&#8221; &#8220;natural science.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;V</span><span class="smcap">erse</span> is in itself music, and the natural symbol
of that union of passion with thought and
pleasure, which constitutes the essence of all poetry
as contradistinguished from history civil or natural.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Coleridge.</i></p>

<p>In the arts of design, colour is to form what verse
is to prose&mdash;a more harmonious and luminous vehicle
of the thought.</p>

<h5>102.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smcap">ubjects</span> and representations in art not elevated
nor interesting in themselves, become instructive
and interesting to higher minds from the <i>manner</i>
in which they have been treated; perhaps because
they have passed through the medium of a higher
mind in taking form.</p>

<p>This is one reason, though we are not always conscious
of it, that the Dutch pictures of common and
vulgar life give us a pleasure apart from their wonderful
finish and truth of detail. In the mind of
the artist there must have been the power to throw
himself into a sphere <i>above</i> what he represents.
Adrian Brouwer, for instance, must have been
something far better than a sot; Ostade something
higher than a boor; though the habits of both led
them into companionship with sots and boors. In
the most farcical pictures of Jan Steen there is a
depth of feeling and observation which remind me
of the humour of Goldsmith; and Teniers, we
know, was in his habits a refined gentleman; the
brilliant elegance of his pencil contrasting with the
grotesque vulgarity of his subjects. To a thinking
mind, some of these Dutch pictures of character are
full of material for thought, pathetic even where
least sympathetic: no doubt, because of a latent
sympathy with the artist, apart from his subject.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><img src="images/illus-012-1.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="125" width="300" /></div>

<h5>103.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smcap">oleridge</span> says,&mdash;&#8220;Every human feeling is greater
and larger than the exciting cause.&#8221; (A philosophical
way of putting Rochefoucauld&#8217;s neatly
expressed apophthegm: &#8220;Nous ne sommes jamais ni
si heureux ni si malheureux que nous l&#8217;imaginons.&#8221;)
&#8220;A proof,&#8221; he proceeds, &#8220;that man is designed for a
higher state of existence; and this is deeply implied
in music, in which there is always something more
and beyond the immediate expression.&#8221;</p>

<p>But not music only, every production of art
ought to excite emotions greater and thoughts larger
than itself. Thoughts and emotions which never
perhaps were in the mind of the artist, never were
anticipated, never were intended by him&mdash;may be
strongly suggested by his work. This is an important
part of the morals of art, which we must never
lose sight of. Art is not only for pleasure and profit,
but for good and for evil.</p>

<p>Goethe (in the <i>Dichtung und Wahrheit</i>) describes
the reception of Marie Antoinette at Strasbourg,
where she passed the frontier to enter her new kingdom.
She was then a lovely girl of sixteen. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
relates that on visiting before her arrival the reception
room on the bridge over the Rhine, where her German
attendants were to deliver her into the hands of
the French authorities, he found the walls hung with
tapestries representing the ominous story of Jason
and Medea&mdash;of all the marriages on record the most
fearful, the most tragic in its consequences. &#8220;What!&#8221;
he exclaims, his poetical imagination struck with the
want of moral harmony, &#8220;was there among these
French architects and decorators no man who could
perceive that pictures represent things,&mdash;that they
have a meaning in themselves,&mdash;that they can impress
sense and feeling,&mdash;that they can awaken presentiments
of good or evil?&#8221; But, as he tells us, his
exclamations of horror were met by the mockery of
his French companions, who assured him that it was
not everybody&#8217;s concern to look for significance in
pictures.</p>

<p>These self-same tapestries of the story of Jason
and Medea were after the Restoration presented by
Louis XVIII. to George IV., and at present they
line the walls of the Ball-room in Windsor Castle.
We might repeat, with some reason, the question of
Goethe; for if pictures have a significance, and speak
to the imagination, what has the tragedy of Jason
and Medea to do in a ball-room?</p>

<p class="tb">Goethe, who thus laid down the principle that works<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
of art speak to the feelings and the conscience, and
can awaken associations tending to good and evil, by
some strange inconsistency places art and artists
out of the sphere of morals. He speaks somewhere
with contempt and ridicule of those who
take their conscience and their morality with them
to an opera or a picture gallery. Yet surely he
is wrong. Why should we not? Are our conscience
and our morals like articles of dress which
we can take off and put on again as we fancy
it convenient or expedient?&mdash;shut up in a drawer
and leave behind us when we visit a theatre or
a gallery of art? or are they not rather a part of
ourselves&mdash;our very life&mdash;to graduate the worth, to
fix the standard of all that mingles with our life?
The idea that what we call <i>taste</i> in art has something
quite distinctive from conscience, is one cause that
the popular notions concerning the productions of
art are abandoned to such confusion and uncertainty;
that simple people regard <i>taste</i> as something
forensic, something to be learned, as they would
learn a language, and mastered by a study of rules
and a dictionary of epithets; and they look up to
a professor of taste, just as they would look up to
a professor of Greek or of Hebrew. Either they
listen to judgments lightly and confidently promulgated
with a sort of puzzled faith and a surrender
of their own moral sense, which are pitiable;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
as if art also had its infallible church and its hierarchy
of dictators!&mdash;or they fly into the opposite
extreme, and seeing themselves deceived and misled,
fall away into strange heresies. All from ignorance
of a few laws simple in their form, yet infinite
in their application;&mdash;<i>natural</i> laws we must call
them, though here applied to art.</p>

<p>In my younger days I have known men conspicuous
for their want of elevated principle, and for their
dissipated habits, held up as arbiters and judges of
art; but it was to them only another form of
epicurism and self-indulgence; and I have seen
them led into such absurd and fatal mistakes for
want of the power to distinguish and to generalise,
that I have despised their judgment, and have come
to the conclusion that a really high standard of taste
and a low standard of morals are incompatible with
each other.</p>

<h5>104.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> fact of the highest artistic genius having
manifested itself in a polytheistic age, and
among a people whose moral views were essentially
degraded, has, we think, fostered the erroneous notion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
that the sphere of art has no connection with that of
morality. The Greeks, with penetrative insight,
dilated the essential characteristics of man&#8217;s organism
as a vehicle of superior intelligence, while their
intense sympathy with physical beauty made them
alive to its most subtle manifestations; and reproducing
their impressions through the medium of art,
they have given birth to models of the human form,
which reveal its highest possibilities, and the excellence
of which depends upon their being individual
expressions of ideal truth. Thus, too, in their descriptions
of nature, instead of multiplying insignificant
details, they seized instinctively upon the
characteristic features of her varying aspects, and not
unfrequently embodied a finished picture in one
comprehensive and harmonious word. In association
with their marvellous genius, however, we find a
cruelty, a treachery, and a licence which would be
revolting if it were not for the historical interest
which attaches to every genuine record of a bygone
age. Their low moral standard cannot excite surprise
when we consider the debasing tendency of
their worship, the objects of their adoration being
nothing more than their own degraded passions invested
with some of the attributes of deity. Now,
among the modifications of thought introduced by
Christianity, there is perhaps none more pregnant
with important results than the harmony which it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
has established between religion and morality. The
great law of right and wrong has acquired a sacred
character, when viewed as an expression of the divine
will; it takes its rank among the eternal verities, and
to ignore it in our delineations of life, or to represent
sin otherwise than as treason against the supreme
ruler, is to retain in modern civilisation one of the
degrading elements of heathenism. Conscience is as
great a fact of our inner life as the sense of beauty,
and the harmonious action of both these instinctive
principles is essential to the highest enjoyment of
art, for any internal dissonance disturbs the repose
of the mind, and thereby shatters the image mirrored
in its depths.&#8221;&mdash;<i>A. S.</i></p>

<h5>106.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smcap">avater</span> told Goethe that on a certain occasion
when he held the velvet bag in the church as
collector of the offerings, he tried to observe only the
hands; and he satisfied himself that in every individual,
the shape of the hand and of the fingers, the
action and sentiment in dropping the gift into the
bag, were distinctly different and individually characteristic.</p>

<p>What then shall we say of Van Dyck, who painted
the hands of his men and women, not from individual
nature, but from a model hand&mdash;his own
very often?&mdash;and every one who considers for a moment
will see in Van Dyck&#8217;s portraits, that, however
well painted and elegant the hands, they in very few
instances harmonise with the <i>personalit&eacute;</i>;&mdash;that the
position is often affected, and as if intended for display,&mdash;the
display of what is in itself a positive fault,
and from which some little knowledge of comparative
physiology would have saved him.</p>

<p>There are hands of various character; the hand to
catch, and the hand to hold; the hand to clasp, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
the hand to grasp. The hand that has worked or
could work, and the hand that has never done anything
but hold itself out to be kissed, like that of
Joanna of Arragon in Raphael&#8217;s picture.</p>

<p>Let any one look at the hands in Titian&#8217;s portrait
of old Paul IV.: though exquisitely modelled, they
have an expression which reminds us of claws; they
belong to the face of that grasping old man, and
could belong to no other.</p>

<h5>107.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">ozart</span> and Chopin, though their genius was differently
developed, were alike in some things:
in nothing more than this, that the artistic element in
both minds wholly dominated over the social and
practical, and that their art was the element in which
they moved and lived, through which they felt and
thought. I doubt whether either of them could have
said, &#8220;<i>D&#8217;abord je suis homme et puis je suis artiste</i>;&#8221;
whereas this could have been said with truth by
Mendelsohn and by Litzst. In Mendelsohn the
enormous creative power was modified by the intellect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
and the conscience. Litzst has no creative
power.</p>

<p>Liszt has thus drawn the character of Chopin:&mdash;&#8220;Rien
n&#8217;&eacute;tait plus pur et plus exalt&eacute; en m&ecirc;me temps
que ses pens&eacute;es; rien n&#8217;&eacute;tait plus tenace, plus exclusif,
et plus minutieusement d&eacute;vou&eacute; que ses affections.
Mais cet &ecirc;tre ne comprenait que ce qui &eacute;tait identique
&agrave; lui-m&ecirc;me:&mdash;le reste n&#8217;existait pour lui que
comme une sorte de r&ecirc;ve f&acirc;cheux, auquel il essayait
de se soustraire en vivant au milieu du monde.
Toujours perdu dans ses r&ecirc;veries, la r&eacute;alit&eacute; lui deplaisait.
Enfant il ne pouvait toucher &agrave; un instrument
tranchant sans se blesser; homme il ne pouvait se
trouver en face d&#8217;un homme diff&eacute;rent de lui, sans se
heurter contre cette contradiction vivante.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ce qui le pr&eacute;servait d&#8217;un antagonisme perp&eacute;tuel
c&#8217;&eacute;tait l&#8217;habitude volontaire et bient&ocirc;t inv&eacute;t&eacute;r&eacute;e de
ne point voir, de ne pas entendre ce qui lui deplaisait:
en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral sans toucher &agrave; ses affections personelles,
les &ecirc;tres qui ne pensaient pas comme lui
devenaient &agrave; ses yeux comme des esp&egrave;ces de fant&ocirc;mes;
et comme il &eacute;tait d&#8217;une politesse charmante, on pouvait
prendre pour une bienveillance courtoise ce qui
n&#8217;&eacute;tait chez lui qu&#8217;un froid d&eacute;dain&mdash;une aversion
insurmontable.&#8221;</p>

<h5>108.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> father of Mozart was a man of high and strict
religious principle. He had a conviction&mdash;in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
case more truly founded than is usual&mdash;that he was
the father of a great, a surpassing genius, and consequently
of a being unfortunate in this, that he
must be in advance of his age, exposed to error, to
envy, to injustice, to strife; and to do his duty to his
son demanded large faith and large firmness. But
because he <i>did</i> estimate this sacred trust as a duty to
be discharged, not only with respect to his gifted son,
but to the God who had so endowed him; so, in spite
of many mistakes, the earnest straightforward endeavour
to do right in the parent seems to have saved
Mozart&#8217;s moral life, and to have given that completeness
to the productions of his genius, which the harmony
of the moral and creative faculties alone can
bestow.</p>

<p class="tb">&#8220;The modifying power of circumstances on Mozart&#8217;s
style, is an interesting consideration. Whatever
of striking, of new or beautiful he met with in
the works of others left its impression on him; and
he often reproduced these efforts, not servilely, but
mingling his own nature and feelings with them in
a manner not less surprising than delightful.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is true equally of Shakespeare and of Raphael,
both of whom adapted or rather adopted much from
their precursors in the way of material to work
upon; and whose incomparable originality consisted
in the interfusion of their own great individual genius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
with every subject they touched, so that it became
theirs, and could belong to no other.</p>

<p class="tb">The Figaro was composed at Vienna. The Don
Juan and Clemenza di Tito at Prague;&mdash;which I
note because the localities are so characteristic of the
operas. Cimarosa&#8217;s Matrimonio Segreto was composed
at Prague; it was on the fortification of the Hradschin
one morning at sun-rise that he composed the
<i>Pria che spunti in ciel l&#8217;aurora</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">When called upon to describe his method of composing,
what Mozart said of himself was very striking
from its <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and truth. &#8220;I do not,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;aim at originality. I do not know in what my originality
consists. Why my productions take from
my hand that particular form or style which makes
them <i>Mozartish</i>, and different from the works of
other composers is probably owing to the same cause
which makes my nose this or that particular shape;
makes it, in short, Mozart&#8217;s nose, and different from
other people&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet, as a composer, Mozart was as <i>objective</i>, as
dramatic, as Shakspeare and Raphael; Chopin, in
comparison, was wholly <i>subjective</i>,&mdash;the Byron of
Music.</p>

Mozart&#8217;s melodies seemed to me not so much composed,

<h5>111.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smcap">very</span> one who remembers what Madlle. Rachel
was seven or eight years ago, and who sees
her now (1853), will allow that she has made no progress
in any of the essential excellences of her art:&mdash;a
certain proof that she is not a great artist in the
true sense of the word. She is a finished actress,
but she is nothing more, and nothing better; not
enough the artist ever to forget or conceal her art;
consequently there is a want somewhere, which a
mind highly toned and of quick perceptions feels from
beginning to end. The parts in which she once excelled&mdash;the
Ph&ecirc;dre and the Hermione, for instance&mdash;have
become formalised and hard, like studies cast
in bronze; and when she plays a new part it has no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
freshness. I always go to see her whenever I can.
I admire her as what she is&mdash;the Parisian actress,
practised in every trick of her <i>m&eacute;tier</i>. I admire what
she does, I think how well it is all <i>done</i>, and am
inclined to clap and applaud her drapery, perfect and
ostentatiously studied in every fold, just with the
same feeling that I applaud herself.</p>

<p>As to the last scene of Adrienne Lecouvreur,
(which those who are <i>avides de sensation</i>, athirst for
painful emotion, go to see as they would drink a
dram, and critics laud as a miracle of art,) it is
altogether a mistake and a failure; it is beyond the
just limits of terror and pity&mdash;beyond the legitimate
sphere of <i>art</i>. It reminds us of the story of Gentil
Bellini and the Sultan. The Sultan much admired
Bellini&#8217;s picture of the decollation of John the Baptist,
but informed him that it was inaccurate&mdash;surgically&mdash;for
the tendons and muscles ought to shrink
where divided; and then calling for one of his slaves,
he drew his scimitar, and striking off the head of the
wretch, gave the horror-struck artist a lesson in
practical anatomy. So we might possibly learn from
Rachel&#8217;s imitative representation, (studied in an hospital
as they say,) how poison acts on the frame, and
how the limbs and features writhe into death; but if
she were a great moral artist she would feel that
what is allowed to be true in painting, is true in art
generally; that mere imitation, such as the vulgar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
delight in, and hold up their hands to see, is the
vulgarest and easiest aim of the imitative arts, and
that between the true interpretation of poetry in art
and such base mechanical means to the lowest ends,
there lies an immeasurable distance.</p>

<p>I am disposed to think that Rachel has not genius,
but talent, and that her talent, from what I see year
after year, has a downward tendency,&mdash;there is not
sufficient moral seasoning to save it from corruption.
I remember that when I first saw her in Hermione
she reminded me of a serpent, and the same impression
continues. The long meagre form with its
graceful undulating movements, the long narrow face
and features, the contracted jaw, the high brow, the
brilliant supernatural eyes which seem to glance every
way at once; the sinister smile; the painted red lips,
which look as though they had lapped, or could lap,
blood; all these bring before me the idea of a Lamia,
the serpent nature in the woman&#8217;s form. In Lydia,
and in Athalie, she touches the extremes of vice and
wickedness with such a masterly lightness and precision,
that I am full of wondering admiration for
the actress. There is not a turn of her figure, not an
expression in her face, not a fold in her gorgeous
drapery, that is not a study; but withal such a
consciousness of her art, and such an ostentation of
the means she employs, that the power remains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
always <i>extraneous</i>, as it were, and exciting only to
the senses and the intellect.</p>

<p>Latterly she has become a hard mannerist. Her
face, once so flexible, has lost the power of expressing
the nicer shades and softer gradations of feeling; so
much so, that they write dramas for her with supernaturally
wicked and depraved heroines to suit her
especial powers. I conceive that an artist could not
sink lower in degradation. Yet to satisfy the taste of
a Parisian audience and the ambition of a Parisian
actress this was not enough, and wickedness required
the piquancy of immediate approximation with
innocence. In the Valeria she played two characters,
and appeared on the stage alternately as a miracle of
vice and a miracle of virtue: an abandoned prostitute
and a chaste matron. There was something in this
contrasted impersonation, considered simply in relation
to the aims and objects of art, so revolting, that
I sat in silent and deep disgust, which was partly
deserved by the audience which could endure the
exhibition.</p>

<p>It is the entire absence of the high poetic and
moral element which distinguishes Rachel as an
actress, and places her at such an immeasurable distance
from Mrs. Siddons, that it shocks me to hear
them named together.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<h5>112.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is no reproach to a capital actress to play effectively
a very wicked character. Mrs. Siddons
played the abandoned Milwood as carefully, as completely
as she played Hermoine and Constance; but
if it had required a perpetual succession of Calistas
and Milwoods to call forth her highest powers, what
should we think of the woman and the artist?</p>

<h5>113.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> dramas and characters are invented to suit
the particular talent of a particular actor or
actress, it argues rather a limited range of the artistic
power; though within that limit the power may be
great and the talent genuine.</p>

<p class="tb">Thus for Liston and for Miss O&#8217;Neil, so distinguished
in their respective lines of Comedy and
Tragedy, characters were especially constructed and
plays written, which have not been acted since their
time.</p>

<h5>114.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> <span class="smcap">celebrated</span> German actress (who has quitted
the stage for many years) speaking of Rachel,
said that the reason she must always stop short of
the highest place in art, is because she is nothing but
an actress&mdash;that only; and has no aims in life, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
no duties, feelings, employments, sympathies, but
those which centre in herself in the interests of her
art;&mdash;which thus ceases to be <i>art</i> and becomes a
<i>m&eacute;tier</i>.</p>

<p>This reminded me of what Pauline Viardot once
said to me:&mdash;&#8220;D&#8217;abord je suis <i>femme</i>, avec les d&eacute;voirs,
les affections, les sentiments d&#8217;une femme; et
puis je suis <i>artiste</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h5>115.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> same German actress whose opinion I have
quoted, told me that the Leonora and the Iphigenia
of Goethe were the parts she preferred to play.
The Thekla and the Beatrice of Schiller next. (In
all these she excelled.) The parts easiest to her,
requiring no effort scarcely, were Jerta (in Houwald&#8217;s
Tragedy, &#8220;Die Schuld&#8221;), and Cl&auml;rchen in Egmont;
of the character of Jerta, she said beautifully:&mdash;&#8220;Ich
habe es nicht gespielt, Ich habe es gesagt!&#8221; (I
did not <i>play</i> it, I <i>uttered</i> it.) This was extremely
characteristic of the woman.</p>

<p>I once asked Mrs. Siddons, which of her great
characters she preferred to play? She replied, after
a moment&#8217;s consideration, and in her rich deliberate
emphatic tones:&mdash;&#8220;Lady Macbeth is the character
I have most <i>studied</i>.&#8221; She afterwards said that she
had played the character during thirty years, and
scarcely acted it once, without carefully reading over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
the part and generally the whole play in the morning;
and that she never read over the play without
finding something new in it; &#8220;something,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;which had not struck me so much as it <i>ought</i> to
have struck me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">Of Mrs. Pritchard, who preceded Mrs. Siddons in
the part of Lady Macbeth, it was well known that
she had never read the play. She merely studied
her own part as written out by the stage-copyist; of
the other parts she knew nothing but the <i>cues</i>.</p>

<h5>116.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> I asked Mrs. Henry Siddons, which of her
characters she preferred playing? she said at
once &#8220;Imogen, in Cymbeline, was the character I
played with most ease to myself, and most success as
regarded the public; it cost no effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was confirmed by others. A very good
judge said of her&mdash;&#8220;In some of her best parts, as
Juliet, Rosalind, and Lady Townley, she may have
been approached or equalled. In Viola and Imogen
she was never equalled. In the grace and simplicity
of the first, in the refinement and shy but impassioned
tenderness of the last, <i>I</i> at least have never
seen any one to be compared to her. She hardly
seemed to <i>act</i> these parts; they came naturally to
her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>This reminds me of another anecdote of the same
accomplished actress and admirable woman. The
people of Edinburgh, among whom she lived, had so
identified her with all that was gentle, refined and
noble, that they did not like to see her play wicked
parts. It happened that Godwin went down to
Edinburgh with a tragedy in his pocket, which had
been accepted by the theatre there, and in which
Mrs. Henry Siddons was to play the principal part&mdash;that
of a very wicked woman (I forget the name
of the piece). He was warned that it risked the
success of his play, but her conception of the part
was so just and spirited, that he persisted. At the
rehearsal she stopped in the midst of one of her
speeches and said, with great <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, &#8220;I am afraid,
Mr. Godwin, the people will not endure to hear me
say this!&#8221; He replied coolly, &#8220;My dear, you cannot
be always young and pretty&mdash;you must come to this
at last,&mdash;go on.&#8221; He mistook her meaning and the
feeling of &#8220;the people.&#8221; The play failed; and the
audience took care to discriminate between their
disapprobation of the piece and their admiration for
the actress.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">adame Schr&oelig;der Devrient</span> told me that she
sung with most pleasure to herself in the
&#8220;Fidelio;&#8221; and in this part I have never seen her
equalled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny Kemble told me the part she had played
with most pleasure to herself, was Camiola, in Massinger&#8217;s
&#8220;Maid of Honour.&#8221; It was an exquisite
impersonation, but the play itself ineffective and
not successful, because of the weak and worthless
character of the hero.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">rs. Charles Kean</span> told me that she had played
with great ease and pleasure to herself, the part
of Ginevra, in Leigh Hunt&#8217;s &#8220;Legend of Florence.&#8221;
She <i>made</i> the part (as it is technically termed), and
it was a very complete and beautiful impersonation.</p>

<p class="tb">These answers appear to me psychologically, as
well as artistically, interesting, and worth preserving.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">rs. Siddons</span>, when looking over the statues in
Lord Lansdowne&#8217;s gallery, told him that one
mode of expressing intensity of feeling was suggested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
to her by the position of some of the Egyptian statues
with the arms close down at the sides and the hands
clenched. This is curious, for the attitude in the
Egyptian gods is intended to express repose. As the
expression of intense passion self-controlled, it might
be appropriate to some characters and not to others.
Rachel, as I recollect, uses it in the Ph&ecirc;dre:&mdash;Madame
Rettich uses it in the Medea. It would not
be characteristic in Constance.</p>

<h5>120.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">n</span> a certain occasion when Fanny Kemble was
reading Cymbeline, a lady next to me remarked
that Imogen ought not to utter the words &#8220;Senseless
linen!&mdash;happier therein than I!&#8221; aloud, and to
Pisanio,&mdash;that it detracted from the strength of the
feeling, and that they should have been uttered aside,
and in a low, intense whisper. &#8220;Iachimo,&#8221; she
added, &#8220;might easily have won a woman who could
have laid her heart so bare to a mere attendant!&#8221;</p>

<p>On my repeating this criticism to Fanny Kemble,
she replied just as I had anticipated: &#8220;Such criticism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
is the mere expression of the natural emotions or
character of the critic. <i>She</i> would have spoken the
words in a whisper; <i>I</i> should have made the exclamation
aloud. If there had been a thousand people by,
I should not have cared for them&mdash;I should not have
been conscious of their presence. I should have
exclaimed before them all, &#8216;Senseless linen!&mdash;happier
therein than I!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus the artist fell into the same mistake of
which she accused her critic&mdash;she made Imogen utter
the words aloud, because <i>she</i> would have done so herself.
This sort of subjective criticism in both was
quite feminine; but the question was not how either
A. B. or F. K. would have spoken the words, but
what would have been most natural in such a woman
as Imogen?</p>

<p>And most undoubtedly the first criticism was as
exquisitely true and just as it was delicate. Such a
woman as Imogen would <i>not</i> have uttered those words
aloud. She would have uttered them in a whisper,
and turning her face from her attendant. With such
a woman, the more intense the passion, the more
conscious and the more veiled the expression.</p>

the encouragement of some distinguished persons of

the &#8216;Shakespeare Club.&#8217;&#8221; There exists a Shakespeare

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> &#8220;Maria Maddalena&#8221; of Friedrich Hebbel is a
domestic tragedy. It represents the position of a
young girl in the lower class of society&mdash;a character
of quiet goodness and feeling, in a position the most
usual, circumstances the most common-place. The
representation is from the life, and set forth with a
truth which in its naked simplicity, almost hardness,
becomes most tragic and terrible. Around this girl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
portrayed with consummate delicacy, is a group of
men. First her father, an honest artisan, coarse,
harsh, despotic. Then a light-minded, good-natured,
dissipated brother, and two suitors. All these love
her according to their masculine individuality. To
the men of her own family she is as a part of the
furniture&mdash;something they are accustomed to see&mdash;necessary
to the daily well-being of the house, without
whom the fire would not be on the hearth, nor
the soup on the table; and they are proud of her
charms and good qualities as belonging to them. By
her lovers she is loved as an object they desire to
possess&mdash;and dispute with each other. But no one
of all these thinks of <i>her</i>&mdash;of what she thinks, feels,
desires, suffers, is, or may be. Nor does she seem to
think of it herself, until the storm falls upon her,
enwraps her, overwhelms her. Then she stands in
the midst of the beings around her, and who are one
and all in a kind of external relation to her, completely
alone. In her grief, in her misery, in her
amazement, her perplexity, her terror, there is no one
to take thought for her, no one to help, no one to
sympathise. Each is self-occupied, self-satisfied.
And so she sinks down and perishes, and they stand
wondering at what they had not the sense to see,
wringing their hands over the irremediable. It is
the Lucy Ashton of vulgar life.</p>

<p>The manners and characters of this play are essen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>tially
German; but the <i>stuff</i>&mdash;the material of the
piece&mdash;the relative position of the personages, might
be true of any place in this christian, civilised
Europe. The whole is wonderfully, painfully
natural, and strikes home to the heart, like Hood&#8217;s
&#8220;Bridge of Sighs.&#8221; It was a surprise to me that
such a piece should have been acted, and with applause,
at the Court Theatre at Vienna; but I believe
it has not been given since 1849.</p>

<h5>123.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smcap">ere</span> is a very good analysis of the artistic nature:
&#8220;Il ressent une v&eacute;ritable &eacute;motion, mais il
s&#8217;arrange pour la montrer. Il fait un peu ce que
faisait cet acteur de l&#8217;antiquit&eacute; qui, venant de perdre
son fils unique et jouant quelque temps apr&egrave;s le r&ocirc;le
d&#8217;Electre embrassant l&#8217;urne d&#8217;Oreste, prit entre ses
mains l&#8217;urne qui contenait les cendres de son enfant,
et joua sa propre douleur, dit Aulus Gellius, au lieu
de jouer celle de son r&ocirc;le. Ce melange de l&#8217;&eacute;motion
naturelle et de l&#8217;&eacute;motion th&eacute;atrale est plus fr&eacute;quent
qu&#8217;on ne croit, surtout &agrave; certaines &eacute;poques quand le
raffinement de l&#8217;Education fait que l&#8217;homme ne sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
pas seulement ses &eacute;motions, mais qu&#8217;il sent aussi
l&#8217;effet qu&#8217;elles peuvent produire. Beaucoup de gens
alors, sont naturellement com&eacute;diens; c&#8217;est &agrave; dire qu&#8217;ils
donnent un r&ocirc;le &agrave; leurs passions: ils sentent en dehors
au lieu de sentir en dedans; leurs &eacute;motions sont
<i>en relief</i> au lieu d&#8217;&ecirc;tre <i>en profondeur</i>.&#8221;&mdash;<i>St. Marc
Girardin.</i></p>

<p>I think Margaret Fuller must have had the above
passage in her mind when she worked out this happy
illustration into a more finished form. She says:&mdash;&#8220;The
difference between the artistic nature and the
unartistic nature in the hour of emotion, is this: in
the first the feeling is a cameo, in the last an intaglio.
Raised in relief and shaped <i>out</i> of the heart in the
first; cut <i>into</i> the heart, and hardly perceptible till
you take the impression, in the last.&#8221;</p>

<p>And to complete this fanciful and beautiful analogy,
we might add, that because the artistic nature
is demonstrative, it is sometimes thought insincere;
and insincere it <i>is</i> where the form is hollow in
proportion as it is cast outward, as in the casts
and electrotype copies of the solid sculpture. And
because the unartistic nature is undemonstrative,
it is sometimes thought cold, unreal; for of this also
there are imitations; and in passing the touch over
certain intaglios, we feel by contact that they are
not so deep as we supposed.</p>

<p>God defend us from both! from the hollowness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
that imitates solidity, and the shallowness that
imitates depth!</p>

<p>This may have been true of the individual woman
referred to; but that female critics look for something
in a production of art beyond the mere handiwork,
and that &#8220;our sympathetic veneration for a creation
of human intellect,&#8221; is often dependent on our moral
associations, is not a reproach to us. Nor, if I may
presume to say so, does it lessen the value of our
criticism, where it can be referred to principles.
Women have a sort of unconscious logic in these
matters.</p>

(<i>Merivale.</i>) True, not of Dante and Shakespeare
only, but of all books worth reading; and not merely
of books and authors, but of all productions of mind
in whatever form which speak to mind; all works of
art, from which we <i>imbibe</i>, as it were, what is sympathetic
with our individuality. The more universal the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
sympathies of the writer or the artist, the more of
such individualities will be included in his domain of
power.</p>

by the Germans (by Lessing first I believe)
between &#8220;Bildende&#8221; and &#8220;Redende Kunst&#8221; is not
to be rendered into English without a lengthy paraphrase.
It places in immediate contradistinction the

<p><span class="dropcap">V</span><span class="smcap">enus</span>, or rather the Greek Aphrodite, in the sublime
fragment of Eschylus (the Dana&iuml;des) is a
grand, severe, and pure conception; the principle
eternal of beauty, of love, and of fecundity&mdash;or the
law of the continuation of being through beauty and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
through love. Such a conception is no more like the
Ovidean Roman Venus than the Venus of Milo is
like the Venus de Medicis.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the Greek tragedy, love figures as one of the
laws of nature&mdash;not as a power, or a passion;
these are the aspects given to it by the Christian
imagination.</p>

<p>Yet this higher idea of love <i>did</i> exist among the
ancients&mdash;only we must not seek it in their poetry,
but in their philosophy. Thus we find it in Plato,
set forth as a beautiful philosophical theory; not as
a passion, to influence life, nor as a poetic feeling, to
adorn and exalt it. Nor do we moderns owe this idea
of a mystic, elevated, and elevating love to the Greek
philosophy. I rather agree with those who trace it
to the mingling of Christianity with the manners of
the old Germans, and their (almost) superstitious
reverence for womanhood. In the Middle Ages,
where morals were most depraved, and women most
helpless and oppressed, there still survived the theory
formed out of the combination of the Christian spirit,
and the Germanic customs; and when in the 15th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
century Plato became the fashion, then the theory
became a science, and what had been religion became
again philosophy. This sort of speculative love became
to real love what theology became to religion;
it was a thesis to be talked about and argued in universities,
sung in sonnets, set forth in art; and so
being kept as far as possible from all bearings on
our moral life, it ceased to find consideration either
as a prim&aelig;val law of God, or as a moral motive
influencing the duties and habits of our existence;
and thus we find the social code in regard to it
diverging into all the vagaries of celibacy on one
hand, and all the vilenesses of profligacy on the
other.</p>

much. His opinions and criticisms on his own

<p>He writes, when travelling in Holland, to his
friend, Sir George Beaumont;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the first circumstances that struck me
wherever I went was what you had prepared me for;
the resemblance that everything bore to the Dutch
and Flemish pictures. On leaving Ostend, not only
the people, houses, trees, but whole tracks of country
reminded me of Teniers, and on getting further
into the country this was only relieved by the pictures
of Rubens and Wouvermans, or some other masters
taking his place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I could trace the particular districts in
Holland where Ostade, Cuyp, and Rembrandt had
studied, and could almost fancy the spot where the
pictures of other masters had been painted. Indeed
nothing seemed new to me in the whole country; and
what one could not help wondering at, was, that
these old masters should have been able to draw the
materials of so beautiful a variety of art, from so
contracted and monotonous a theme.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their variety arose out of their truthfulness. I
had the same feeling when travelling in Holland and
Belgium. It was to me a perpetual succession of
reminiscences, and so it has been with others.
Rubens and Rembrandt (as landscape painters)&mdash;Cuyp,
Hobbima, were continually in my mind;
occasionally the yet more poetical Ruysdaal; but
who ever thinks of Wouvermans, or Bergham, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Karel du Jardin, as national or natural painters?
their scenery is all <i>got up</i> like the scenery in a ballet,
and I can conceive nothing more tiresome than a
room full of their pictures, elegant as they are.</p>

<h5>131.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">gain</span>, writing from Jerusalem, Wilkie says,
&#8220;Nothing here requires revolution in our
opinions of the finest works of art: with all their
discrepancies of detail, they are yet constantly recalled
by what is here before us. The background
of the Heliodorus of Raphael is a Syrian building;
the figures in the Lazarus of Sebastian del Piombo
are a Syrian people; and the indescribable tone of
Rembrandt is brought to mind at every turn, whether
in the street, the Synagogue, or the Sepulchre.&#8221;
And again: &#8220;The painter we are always referring
to, as one who has most truly given the eastern
people, is Rembrandt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He partly contradicts this afterwards, but says,
that Venetian art reminds him of Syria. Now, the
Venetians were in constant communication with the
East; all their art has a tinge of orientalism. As to
Rembrandt, he must have been in familiar intercourse
with the Jew merchants and Jewish families
settled in the Dutch commercial towns; he painted
them frequently as portraits, and they perpetually
appear in his compositions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<h5>132.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the following passage Wilkie seems unconsciously
to have anticipated the invention (or
rather the <i>discovery</i>) of the Daguerreotype, and some
of its results. He says:&mdash;&#8220;If by an operation of
mechanism, animated nature could be copied with
the accuracy of a cast in plaster, a tracing on a wall,
or a reflection in a glass, without modification, and
without the proprieties and graces of art, all that
utility could desire would be perfectly attained, but
it would be at the expense of almost every quality
which renders art delightful.&#8221;</p>

<p>One reason why the Daguerreotype portraits are
in general so unsatisfactory may perhaps be traced to
a natural law, though I have not heard it suggested.
It is this: every object that we behold we see not
with the eye only, but with the soul; and this is
especially true of the human countenance, which in
so far as it is the expression of mind we see through
the medium of our own individual mind. Thus a
portrait is satisfactory in so far as the painter has
sympathy with his subject, and delightful to us in
proportion as the resemblance reflected through <i>his</i>
sympathies is in accordance with <i>our own</i>. Now in the
Daguerreotype there is no such medium, and the face
comes before us without passing through the human
mind and brain to our apprehension. This may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
the reason why a Daguerreotype, however beautiful
and accurate, is seldom satisfactory or agreeable, and
that while we acknowledge its truth as to fact, it
always leaves something for the sympathies to desire.</p>

<h5>133.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>e says, &#8220;One thing alone seems common in all
the stages of early art; the desire of making
all other excellences tributary to the expression of
thought and sentiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The early painters had <i>no other</i> excellences except
those of thought and expression; therefore could
not sacrifice what they did not possess. They drew
incorrectly, coloured ineffectively, and were ignorant
of perspective.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/illus-146.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="300" width="500" /></div>

<h5>134.</h5>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> at Dusseldorf, I found the President of the
Academy, Wilhelm Schadow, employed on a
church picture in three compartments; Paradise in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
the centre; on the right side, Purgatory; on the left
side, Hell. He explained to me that he had not
attempted to paint the interior of Paradise as the
sojourn of the blessed, because he could imagine no
kind of occupation or delight which, prolonged to
eternity, would not be wearisome. He had therefore
represented the exterior of Paradise, where
Christ, standing on the threshold with outstretched
arms, receives and welcomes those who enter. (This
was better and in finer taste than the more common
allegory of St. Peter and his keys.) On one side of
the door, the Virgin Mary and a group of guardian
angels encourage those who approach. Among these
we distinguish a martyr who has died for the truth,
and a warrior who has fought for it. A care-worn,
penitent mother is presented by her innocent daughter.
Those who were &#8220;in the world and the world
knew them not,&#8221; are here acknowledged&mdash;and eyes
dim with weeping, and heads bowed with shame, are
here uplifted, and bright with the rapturous gleam
which shone through the portals of Paradise.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> idea of Purgatory, he told me, was suggested
by a vision or dream related by St. Catherine of
Genoa, in which she beheld a great number of men
and women shut up in a dark cavern; angels descending
from heaven, liberate them from time to
time, and they are borne away one after another
from darkness, pain, and penance, into life and light&mdash;again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
to behold the face of their Maker&mdash;reconciled
and healed. In his picture, Schadow has represented
two angels bearing away a liberated soul.
Below in the fore-ground groups of sinners are waiting,
sadly, humbly, but not unhopefully, the term of
their bitter penance. Among these he had placed a
group of artists and poets who, led away by temptation,
had abused their glorious gifts to wicked or
worldly purposes;&mdash;Titian, Ariosto, and, rather to
my surprise, the beautiful, lamenting spirit of Byron.
Then, what was curious enough, as types of ambition,
Lady Macbeth and her husband, who, it seems, were
to be ultimately saved, I do not know why&mdash;unless
for the love of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Hell, like all the hells I ever saw, was a failure.
There was the usual amount of fire and flames,
dragons and serpents, ghastly, despairing spirits, but
nothing of original or powerful conception. When
I looked in Schadow&#8217;s face, so beautiful with benevolence,
I wondered <i>how</i> he could&mdash;but in truth he
could <i>not</i>&mdash;realise to himself the idea of a hell; all
the materials he had used were borrowed and common-place.</p>

<p>But among his cartoons for pictures already
painted, there was one charming idea of quite a
different kind. It was for an altar, and he called it
&#8220;<span class="smcap">The Fountain of Life</span>.&#8221; Above, the sacrificed
Redeemer lies extended in his mother&#8217;s arms. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
pure abundant Waters of Salvation, gushing from
the rock beneath their feet, are received into a great
cistern. Saints, martyrs, teachers of the truth, are
standing round, drinking or filling their vases, which
they present to each other. From the cistern flows
a stream, at which a family of poor peasants are
drinking with humble, joyful looks; and as the
stream divides and flows away through flowery meadows,
little sportive children stoop to drink of it,
scooping up the water in their tiny hands, or sipping
it with their rosy smiling lips. A beautiful and
significant allegory beautifully expressed, and as
intelligible to the people as any in the &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress.&#8221;</p>

just; as a portrait-painter he could not well do
otherwise; his profession was to represent the people
among whom he lived. An artist who takes the
higher, the creative and imaginative walks of art, and
who thinks he can, at the same time, live for and
with the age, and for the passing and clashing interests
of the world, and the frivolities of society,
does so at a great risk: there must be perilous discord
between the inner and the outer life&mdash;such
discord as wears and irritates the whole physical and
moral being. Where the original material of the
character is not strong, the artistic genius will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
gradually enfeebled and conventionalised, through
flattery, through sympathy, through misuse. If the
material be strong, the result may perhaps be worse;
the genius may be demoralised and the mind lose its
balance. I have seen in my time instances of both.</p>

<p>This is especially true with regard to art: but

<p>This is the fault of Michal-Angelo; yet I have
sometimes thought that his very materialism, so
grand, and so peculiar in character, may have arisen
out of his profound religious feeling, his stern
morality, his lofty conceptions of our <i>mortal</i>, as well
as <i>immortal</i> destinies. He appears to have beheld
the human form only in a pure and sublime point of
view; not as the animal man, but as the habitation,
fearfully and wondrously constructed, for the spirit
of man,&mdash;</p>

<p>This is the reason that Michal-Angelo&#8217;s materialism
affects us so differently from that of Rubens. In
the first, the predominance of form attains almost a
moral sublimity. In the latter, the predominance of
flesh and blood is debased into physical grossness.
Michal-Angelo believed in the resurrection of <span class="smcap">THE
BODY</span>, emphatically; and in his Last Judgment the
dead rise like Titans, strong to contend and mighty
to suffer. It is the apotheosis of form. In Ruben&#8217;s
picture of the same subject (at Munich) the bodily
presence of resuscitated life is revolting, reminding
us of the text of St. Paul&mdash;&#8220;Flesh and blood shall
<i>not</i> inherit the kingdom of God.&#8221; Both pictures are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
<i>&aelig;sthetically</i> false, but <i>artistically</i> miracles, and should
thus be considered and appreciated.</p>

<h4>A FRAGMENT ON SCULPTURE.</h4>

<h5>AND ON CERTAIN CHARACTERS IN HISTORY AND POETRY CONSIDERED
AS SUBJECTS OF MODERN ART.</h5>

<h5>1848.</h5>

<p>I Should begin by admitting the position laid down
by Frederick Schlegel, that art and nature are not
identical. &#8220;Men,&#8221; he says, &#8220;traduce nature, who
falsely give her the epithet of artistic;&#8221; for though
nature comprehends all art, art cannot comprehend
all nature. Nature, in her sources of pleasures and
contemplation is infinite; and art, as her reflection
in human works, finite. Nature is boundless in her
powers, exhaustless in her variety; the powers of
art and its capabilities of variety in production are
bounded on every side. Nature herself, the infinite,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
has circumscribed the bounds of finite art; the one
is the divinity; the other, the priestess. And if
poetic art in the <i>interpreting</i> of nature share in her
infinitude, yet in <i>representing</i> nature through material,
form, and colour, she is,&mdash;oh, how limited!</p>

<p class="tb">If each of the forms of poetic art has its law of
limitation as determined as the musical scale, narrowest
of all are the limitations of sculpture, to
which, notwithstanding, we give the highest place;
and it is in regard to sculpture, we find most frequently
those mistakes which arise from a want of
knowledge of the true principles of art.</p>

<p>Admitting, then, as necessary and immutable, the
limitations of the art of sculpture as to the management
of the material in giving form and expression;
its primal laws of repose and simplicity; its rejection
of the complex and conventional; its bounded capabilities
as to choice of subject; must we also admit,
with some of the most celebrated critics of art, that
there is but one style of sculpture, the Greek? And
that every deviation from pure Greek art must be
regarded as a depravation and perversion of the
powers and subjects of sculpture? I do not see that
this follows.</p>

<p class="tb">It is absolute that Greek art reached long ago the
term of its development. In so far as regards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
principles of beauty and execution, it can go no farther.
We may stand and look at the relics of the
Parthenon in awe and in despair; we can do neither
more, nor better. But we have not done with Greek
sculpture. What in it is purely <i>ideal</i>, is eternal;
what is conventional, is in accordance with the primal
conditions of all imitative art. Therefore though
it may have reached the point at which development
stops, and though its capability of adaptation
be limited by necessary laws; still its all-beautiful,
its immortal imagery is ever near us and around
us; still &#8220;doth the old feeling bring back the
old names,&#8221; and with the old names, the forms; still,
in those old familiar forms we continue to clothe all
that is loveliest in visible nature; still, in all our
associations with Greek art&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;&#8217;Tis Jupiter who brings whate&#8217;er is great,</span>
<span class="i0">And Venus who brings every thing that&#8217;s fair.&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>That the supreme beauty of Greek art&mdash;that the
majestic significance of the classical myths&mdash;will ever
be to the educated mind and eye as things indifferent
and worn out, I cannot believe.</p>

<p class="tb">But on the other hand it may well be doubted
whether the impersonation of the Greek allegories
in the purest forms of Greek art will ever give
intense pleasure to the people, or ever speak home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
to the hearts of the men and women of these times.
And this not from the want of an innate taste and
capacity in the minds of the masses&mdash;not because
ignorance has &#8220;frozen the genial current in their
souls&#8221;&mdash;not merely through a vulgar preference for
mechanical imitation of common and familiar forms;
but from other causes not transient&mdash;not accidental.
A classical education is not now, as heretofore, the
<i>only</i> education given; and through an honest and
intense sympathy with the life of their own experience,
and through a dislike to vicious associations,
though clothed in classical language and classical
forms, <i>thence</i> is it that the people have turned with
a sense of relief from gods and goddesses, Ledas and
Antiopes, to shepherds and shepherdesses, groups of
Charity, and young ladies in the character of Innocence,&mdash;harmless,
picturesque inanities, bearing the
same relation to classical sculpture that Watts&#8217;s
hymns bear to Homer and Sophocles.</p>

<p class="tb">Classical attainments of any kind are rare in our
English sculptors; therefore it is, that we find them
often quite familiar with the conventional treatment
and outward forms of the usual subjects of Greek
art, without much knowledge of the original poetical
conception, its derivation, or its significance; and
equally without any real appreciation of the idea of
which the form is but the vehicle. Hence they do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
not seem to be aware how far this original conception
is capable of being varied, modified, <i>animated</i>
as it were, with an infusion of fresh life, without
deviating from its essential truth, or transgressing
those narrow limits, within which all sculpture must
be bounded in respect to action and attitude. To
express <i>character</i> within these limits is the grand
difficulty. We must remember that too much value
given to the head as the seat of mind, too much
expression given to the features as the exponents
of character, must diminish the importance of those
parts of the form on which sculpture mainly depends
for its effect on the imagination. To convey the
idea of a complete individuality in a single figure,
and under these restrictions, is the problem to be
solved by the sculptor who aims at originality, yet
feels his aspirations restrained by a fine taste and circumscribed
by certain inevitable associations.</p>

<p class="tb">It is therefore a question open to argument and
involving considerations of infinite delicacy and
moment, in morals and in art, whether the old
Greek legends, endued as they are with an imperishable
vitality derived from their abstract youth, may
not be susceptible of a treatment in modern art analogous
to that which they have received in modern
poetry, where the significant myth, or the ideal
character, without losing its classic grace, has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
animated with a purer sentiment, and developed into
a higher expressiveness. Wordsworth&#8217;s Dion and
Laodomia; Shelley&#8217;s version of the Hymn to Mercury;
Goethe&#8217;s Iphigenia; Lord Byron&#8217;s Prometheus;
Keats&#8217;s Hyperion; Barry Cornwall&#8217;s Proserpina;
are instances of what I mean in poetry. To
do the same thing in art, requires that our sculptors
should stand in the same relation to Phidias and
Praxiteles, that our greatest poets bear to Homer or
Euripides; that they should be themselves poets
and interpreters, not mere translators and imitators.</p>

<p>Further, we all know, that there is often a necessity
for conveying abstract ideas in the forms of art.
We have then recourse to allegory; yet allegorical
statues are generally cold and conventional and
addressed to the intellect merely. Now there are
occasions, in which an abstract quality or thought is
far more impressively and intelligibly conveyed by
an <i>impersonation</i> than by a <i>personification</i>. I mean,
that Aristides might express the idea of justice;
Penelope, that of conjugal faith; Jonathan and
David (or Pylades and Orestes), friendship; Rizpah,
devotion to the memory of the dead; Iphigenia,
the voluntary sacrifice for a good cause; and so of
many others; and such figures would have this advantage,
that with the significance of a symbol they
would combine all the powers of a sympathetic
reality.</p>

<h4>HELEN.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smcap">have</span> never seen any statue of Helen, ancient or
modern. Treated in the right spirit, I can hardly
conceive a diviner subject for a sculptor. It would
be a great mistake to represent the Greek Helen
merely as a beautiful and alluring woman. This, at
least, is not the Homeric conception of the character,
which has a wonderful and fascinating individuality,
requiring the utmost delicacy and poetic feeling to
comprehend, and rare artistic skill to realise. The
oft-told story of the Grecian painter, who, to create
a Helen, assembled some twenty of the fairest models
he could find, and took from each a limb or a feature,
in order to compose from their separate beauties an
ideal of perfection,&mdash;this story, if it were true, would
only prove that even Zeuxis could make a great mistake.
Such a combination of heterogeneous elements
would be psychologically and artistically false, and
would never give us a Helen.</p>

<p>She has become the ideal type of a fatal, faithless,
dissolute woman; but according to the Greek myth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
she is <i>predestined</i>,&mdash;at once the instrument and the
victim of that fiat of the gods which had long before
decreed the destruction of Troy, and <i>her</i> to be the
cause. She must not only be supremely beautiful,&mdash;&#8220;a
daughter of the gods, divinely tall, and most
divinely fair!&#8221;&mdash;but as the offspring of Zeus (the
title by which she is so often designated in the Iliad),
as the sister of the great twin demi-gods Castor and
Pollux, she should have the heroic lineaments proper
to her Olympian descent, touched with a pensive
shade; for she laments the calamities which her fatal
charms have brought on all who have loved her, all
whom she has loved:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;Ah! had I died ere to these shores I fled,</span>
<span class="i0">False to my country and my nuptial bed!&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>She shrinks from the reproachful glances of those
whom she has injured; and yet, as it is finely intimated,
wherever she appears her resistless loveliness
vanquishes every heart, and changes curses into
blessings. Priam treats her with paternal tenderness;
Hector with a sort of chivalrous respect.</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">

<span class="i0">A deed ungentle or a word unkind.&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>Helen, standing on the walls of Troy, and looking
sadly over the battle plain, where the heroes of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
forfeited country, her kindred and her friends, are
assembled to fight and bleed for her sake, brings
before us an image full of melancholy sweetness as
well as of consummate beauty. Another passage in
which she upbraids Venus as the cause of her fault&mdash;not
as a mortal might humbly expostulate with
an immortal, but almost on terms of equality, and
even with bitterness,&mdash;is yet more characteristic.
&#8220;For what,&#8221; she asks, tauntingly, &#8220;am I reserved?
To what new countries am I destined to carry war
and desolation? For what new lover must I break
a second vow? Let me go hence! and if Paris
lament my absence, let Venus console him, and for
his sake ascend the skies no more!&#8221; A regretful
pathos should mingle with her conscious beauty and
her half-celestial dignity; and, to render her truly,
her Greek elegance should be combined with a deeper
and more complex sentiment than Greek art has
usually sought to express.</p>

<p>I am speaking here of Homer&#8217;s Helen&mdash;the
Helen of the Iliad, not the Helen of the tragedians&mdash;not
the Helen who for two thousand years has
merely served &#8220;to point a moral;&#8221; and an artist
who should think to realise the true Homeric conception,
should beware of counterfeits, for such are
abroad.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>
<p>There is a wild Greek myth that it was not the
real Helen, but the phantom of Helen, who fled with
Paris, and who caused the destruction of Troy;
while Helen herself was leading, like Penelope, a
pattern life at Memphis. I must confess I prefer
the proud humility, the pathetic elegance of Homer&#8217;s
Helen, to such jugglery.</p>

<p>It may flatter the pride of virtue, or it may move
our religious sympathies, to look on the forlorn
abasement of the Magdalene as the emblem of penitence;
but there are associations connected with
Helen&mdash;&#8220;sad Helen,&#8221; as she calls herself, and as I
conceive the character,&mdash;which have a deep tragic
significance; and surely there are localities for which
the impersonation of classical art would be better
fitted than that of sacred art.</p>

<p>I do not know of any existing statue of Helen.
Nicetas mentions among the relics of ancient art
destroyed when Constantinople was sacked by the
Latins in 1202, a bronze statue of Helen, with long
hair flowing to the waist; and there is mention of
an Etruscan figure of her, with wings (expressive of
her celestial origin, for the Etruscans gave all their
gods and demi-gods wings): in M&uuml;ller I find these
two only. There are likewise busts; and the story
of Helen, and the various events of her life, occur
perpetually on the antique gems, bas-reliefs, and
painted vases. The most frequent subject is her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
abduction by Paris. A beautiful subject for a bas-relief,
and one I believe not yet treated, would be
Helen and Priam mourning over the lifeless form of
Hector; yet the difficulty of preserving the simple
sculptural treatment, and at the same time discriminating
between this and other similar funereal groups,
would render it perhaps a better subject for a picture,
as admitting then of such scenery and accessories as
would at once determine the signification.</p>

<h4>
PENELOPE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALCESTIS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAODAMIA.
</h4>

<p>Statues of Penelope and Helen might stand in
beautiful and expressive contrast; but it is a contrast
which no profane or prosaic hand should attempt to
realise. Penelope is all woman in her tenderness
and her truth; Helen, half a goddess in the midst of
error and remorse.</p>

<p>Nor is Penelope the only character which might
stand as a type of conjugal fidelity in contrasted
companionship with Helen: Alcestis, who died for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
her husband; or, better still, Laodamia, whose intense
love and longing recalled hers from the shades
below, are susceptible of the most beautiful statuesque
treatment; only we must bear in mind that
the leading <i>motif</i> in the Alcestis is <i>duty</i>, in the
Laodamia, <i>love</i>.</p>

<p>I remember a bas-relief in the Vatican, which
represents Hermes restoring Protesilaus to his mourning
wife. The interview was granted for three hours
only; and when the hero was taken from her a second
time, she died on the threshhold of her palace. This
is a frequent and appropriate subject for sarcophagi
and funereal vases. But there exists, I believe, no
single statue commemorative of the wife&#8217;s passionate
devotion.</p>

<p>The modern sculptor should penetrate his fancy
with the sentiment of Wordsworth&#8217;s Laodamia.</p>

<p class="tb">While the pen is in my hand I may remark that
two of the stanzas in the Laodamia have been
altered, and, as it seems to me, not improved, since
the first edition. Originally the poem opened thus:</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;With sacrifice, before the rising morn</span>
<span class="i0">Perform&#8217;d, my slaughter&#8217;d lord have I required;</span>
<span class="i0">And in thick darkness, amid shades forlorn,</span>
<span class="i0">Him of the infernal Gods have I desired:</span>
<span class="i0">Celestial pity I again implore;</span>
<span class="i0">Restore him to my sight&mdash;great Jove, restore!&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<p>Altered thus, and comparatively flat:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;With sacrifice before the rising morn</span>
<span class="i0">Vows have I made, by fruitless hope inspired;</span>
<span class="i0">And from the infernal Gods, mid shades forlorn</span>
<span class="i0">Of night, my slaughtered lord have I required:</span>
<span class="i0">Celestial pity I again implore;</span>
<span class="i0">Restore him to my sight&mdash;great Jove, restore!&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>In the early edition the last stanza but one stood
thus:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;Ah! judge her gently who so deeply loved!</span>
<span class="i0">Her who, in reason&#8217;s spite, yet without crime,</span>
<span class="i0">Was in a trance of passion thus removed;</span>
<span class="i0">Delivered from the galling yoke of time,</span>
<span class="i0">And these frail elements,&mdash;to gather flowers</span>
<span class="i0">Of blissful quiet &#8217;mid unfading bowers!&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>In the later editions thus altered, and, to my taste,
spoiled:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;By no weak pity might the Gods be moved;</span>
<span class="i0">She who thus perish&#8217;d not without the crime</span>
<span class="i0">Of lovers that in Reason&#8217;s spite have loved,</span>
<span class="i0">Was doomed to wander in a grosser clime</span>
<span class="i0">Apart from happy ghosts, that gather flowers</span>
<span class="i0">Of blissful quiet &#8217;mid unfading bowers.&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>Altered, probably, because Virgil has introduced
the shade of Laodamia among the criminal and unhappy
lovers,&mdash;an instance of extraordinary bad taste
in the Roman poet; whatever may have been her
faults, she surely deserved to be placed in better
company than Ph&aelig;dra and Pasiph&auml;e. Wordsworth&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
intuitive feeling and taste were true in the first
instance, and he might have trusted to them. In
my own copy of Wordsworth I have been careful
to mark the original reading in justice to the
<i>original</i> Laodamia.</p>

<h4>
HIPPOLYTUS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEOPTOLEMUS.
</h4>

<p>I have never met with a statue, ancient or modern,
of Hippolytus; the finest possible ideal of a Greek
youth, touched with some individual characteristics
which are peculiarly fitted for sculpture. He is a
hunter, not a warrior; a tamer of horses, not a combatant
with spear and shield. He should have the
slight, agile build of a young Apollo, but nothing of
the God&#8217;s effeminacy; on the contrary, there should
be an infusion of the severe beauty of his Amazonian
mother, with that sedateness and modesty which
should express the votary and companion of Diana;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
while, as the fated victim of Venus, whom he had
contemned, and of his stepmother Ph&aelig;dra, whom he
had repulsed, there should be a kind of melancholy
in his averted features. A hound and implements of
the chase would be the proper accessories, and the
figure should be undraped, or nearly so.</p>

<p>A sculptor who should be tempted to undertake
this fine, and, as I think, untried subject&mdash;at least
as a single figure&mdash;must begin by putting Racine
out of his mind, whose &#8220;Seigneur Hippolyte&#8221; makes
sentimental love to the &#8220;Princesse Aricie,&#8221; and
must penetrate his fancy with the conception of
Euripides.</p>

<p class="tb">I find in Schlegel&#8217;s &#8220;Essais litt&eacute;raires,&#8221; a few lines
which will assist the fancy of the artist, in representing
the person and character of Hippolytus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quant &agrave; l&#8217;Hippolyte d&#8217;Euripide il a une teinte
si divine que pour le sentir dignement il faut, pour
ainsi dire, &ecirc;tre initi&eacute; dans les myst&egrave;res de la beaut&eacute;,
avoir respir&eacute; l&#8217;air de la Gr&egrave;ce. Rappelez vous ce que
l&#8217;antiquit&eacute; nous a transmis de plus accompli parmi
les images d&#8217;une jeunesse h&eacute;ro&iuml;que, les Dioscures de
Monte-Cavallo, le M&eacute;l&eacute;agre et l&#8217;Apollon du Vatican.
Le caract&egrave;re d&#8217;Hippolyte occupe dans la
po&euml;sie &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s la m&ecirc;me place que ces statues
dans la sculpture.&#8221; &#8220;On peut remarquer dans plusieurs
beaut&eacute;s id&eacute;ales de l&#8217;antique que les anciens
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
voulant cr&eacute;er une image perfectionn&eacute;e de la nature
humaine ont fondu les nuances du caract&egrave;re d&#8217;un
sexe avec celui de l&#8217;autre; que Junon, Pallas, Diane,
out une majest&eacute;, une s&eacute;v&eacute;rit&eacute; m&acirc;le; qu&#8217; Apollon,
Mercure, Bacchus, au contraire, ont quelque chose
de la grace et de la douceur des femmes. De m&ecirc;me
nous voyons dans la beaut&eacute; h&eacute;ro&iuml;que et vierge
d&#8217;Hippolyte l&#8217;image de sa m&egrave;re l&#8217;Amazone et le
reflet de Diane dans un mortel.&#8221;</p>

<p>(The last lines are especially remarkable, and are
an artistic commentary on what I have ventured to
touch upon ethically at page 85.)</p>

<p class="tb">The story of Hippolytus is to be found in bas-reliefs
and gems; it occurs on a particularly fine
sarcophagus now preserved in the cathedral at
Agrigentum, of which there is a cast in the British
Museum.</p>

<p class="tb">Under the heroic and classical form, Hippolytus
conveys the same idea of manly chastity and self-control
which in sacred art would be suggested by
the figure of Joseph, the son of Jacob.</p>

<p class="tb">A noble companion to the Hippolytus would be
Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles. He is the young
Greek warrior, strong and bold and brave; a fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
ideal type of generosity and truth. The conception,
as I imagine it, should be taken from the Philoctetes
of Sophocles, where Neoptolemus, indignant at the
craft of Ulysses, discloses the trick of which he had
been made the unwilling instrument, and restores
the fatal, envenomed arrows to Philoctetes. The
celebrated lines in the Iliad spoken by Achilles&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;Who dares think one thing and another tell</span>
<span class="i0">My soul detests him as the gates of hell!&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>should give the leading characteristic <i>motif</i> in the
figure of his son. There should be something of
remorseful pity in the very youthful features; the
form ought to be heroically treated, that is, undraped,
and he should hold the arrows in his hand.</p>

<p>Neoptolemus, as the savage avenger of his father&#8217;s
death, slaying the grey-haired Priam at the foot of
the altar, and carrying off Andromache, is, of course,
quite a different version of the character. He then
figures as Pyrrhus&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</span>
<span class="i0">Black as his purpose, did the night resemble.&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>The fine moral story of Neoptolemus and Philoctetes
is figured on the Etruscan vases. Of the
young, truth-telling, Greek hero I find no single
statue.</p>

<h4>IPHIGENIA.</h4>

<p>I have often been surprised that we have no statue
of this eminently beautiful subject. We have the
story of Iphigenia constantly repeated in gems and
bas-reliefs; the most celebrated example extant being
the Medici Vase. But no single figure of Iphigenia,
as the Greek ideal of heroic maidenhood and self-devotion,
exists, I believe, in antique sculpture.
The small and rather feebly elegant statuette by
Christian Tieck is the only modern example I have
seen.</p>

<p>Iphigenia may be represented under two very
different aspects, both beautiful.</p>

<p>First, as the Iphigenia in Aulis; the victim sacrificed
to obtain a fair wind for the Grecian fleet
detained on its way to Troy. Extreme youth and
grace, with a tender resignation not devoid of
dignity, should be the leading characteristics; for
we must bear in mind that Iphigenia, while regretting
life and the &#8220;lamp-bearing day,&#8221; and &#8220;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
beloved light,&#8221; and her Argive home and her
&#8220;Mycenian handmaids,&#8221; dies willingly, as the Greek
girl ought to die, for the good of her country.
She begins, indeed, with a prayer for pity, with lamentations
for her untimely end, but she resumes
her nobler self; and all her sentiments, when she is
brought forth, crowned for sacrifice, are worthy of the
daughter of Agamemnon. She even exults that she
is called upon to perish for the good of Greece, and
to avenge the cause of right on the Spartan Helen.
&#8220;I give,&#8221; she exclaims, &#8220;my life for Greece! sacrifice
me&mdash;and let Troy perish!&#8221; When her mother
weeps, she reproves those tears: &#8220;It is not well,
O my mother! that I should love life too much.
Think that thou hast brought me forth for the common
good of Greece, not for thyself only!&#8221; She
glories in her anticipated renown, not vainly, since,
while the world endures, and far as the influences
of literature and art extend, her story and her
name shall live. The scene in Euripides should be
taken as the basis of the character&mdash;the finest
scene in his finest drama. The tradition that Iphigenia
was not really sacrificed, but snatched away
from the altar by Diana, and a hind substituted in
her place, should be present to the fancy of the
artist, when he sets himself to represent the majestic
resignation of the consecrated virgin; as adding a
touch of the marvellous and ideal to the Greek elegance
and simplicity of the conception.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>picture</i> of Iphigenia as drawn by Tennyson
is wonderfully vivid; but it wants the Greek dignity
and statuesque feeling; it is emphatically a
picture, all over colour and light, and crowded with
accessories. He represents her as encountering
Helen in the land of Shadows, and, turning from her
&#8220;with sick and scornful looks averse,&#8221; for she remembers
the tragedy at Aulis.</p>

<p>The famous picture of the sacrifice of Iphigenia by
Timanthes, the theme of admiration and criticism for
the last two thousand years, which every writer on art
deems it proper to mention in praise or in blame, could
hardly have been more vivid or more terrible than this.</p>

<p>The analogous idea, that of heroic resignation and
self-devotion in a great cause, would be conveyed in
sacred art by the figure of Jephtha&#8217;s daughter; she
too regrets the promises of life, but dies not the less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
willingly. &#8220;My father, if thou hast opened thy
mouth unto the Lord, do to me according to that
which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch
as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine
enemies, even of the children of Ammon.&#8221; And for
a single statue, Jephtha&#8217;s daughter would be a fine
subject&mdash;one to task the powers of our best sculptors;
the <i>sentiment</i> would be the same as the Iphigenia,
but the <i>treatment</i> altogether different.</p>

<p class="tb">For the Iphigenia in Tauris I think the modern
sculptor would do well to set aside the character as
represented by Euripides, and rather keep in view the
conception of Goethe.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> In his hand it has lost nothing
of its statuesque elegance and simplicity, and has
gained immeasurably in moral dignity and feminine
tenderness. The Iphigenia in Tauris is no longer
young, but she is still the consecrated virgin; no
more the victim, but herself the priestess of those
very rites by which she was once fated to perish.
While Euripides has depicted her as stern and astute,
Goethe has made her the impersonation of female
devotedness, and mild, but unflinching integrity. She
is like the young Neoptolemus when she disdains to
use the stratagem which Pylades had suggested, when</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>
<p>she dares to speak the truth, and trust to it alone for
help and safety. The scene in which she is haunted
by the recollection of her doomed ancestry, and
mutters over the song of the Parc&aelig; on that far-off
sullen shore, is sublime, but incapable of representation
in plastic art. It should, however, be well
studied, as helping the artist to the abstract conception
of the character as a whole.</p>

<p>Carstens made a design, suggested by this tragedy,
of the Three Parc&aelig; singing their fatal mysterious
song. A model of one of the figures (that of Atropos)
used to stand in Goethe&#8217;s library, and a cast from
this is before me while I write: every one who sees
it takes it for an antique.</p>

<h4>EVE.</h4>

<p>I have but a few words to say of Eve. As she is
the only undraped figure which is allowable in sacred
art, the sculptors have multiplied representations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
her, more or less finely imagined; but what I conceive
to be the true type has seldom, very seldom,
been attained. The remarks which follow are, however,
suggestive, not critical.</p>

<p>It appears to me&mdash;and I speak it with reverence&mdash;that
the Miltonic type is not the highest conceivable,
nor the best fitted for sculptural treatment.
Milton has evidently lavished all his power on this
fairest of created beings; but he makes her too
nymph-like&mdash;too goddess-like. In one place he
compares her to a Wood-nymph, Oread, or Dryad
of the groves; in another to Diana&#8217;s self, &#8220;though
not, as she, with bow and quiver armed.&#8221; The scriptural
conception of our first parent is not like this;
it is ampler, grander, nobler far. I fancy her the
sublime ideal of maternity. It may be said that
this idea of her predestined motherhood should not
predominate in the conception of Eve before the
Fall: but I think it should.</p>

<p>It is most beautifully imagined by Milton that
Eve, separated from her mate, her Adam, is weak,
and given over to the merely womanish nature, for
only when linked together and supplying the complement
to each other&#8217;s <i>moral</i> being, can man or
woman be strong; but we must also remember that
the &#8220;spirited sly snake,&#8221; in tempting Eve, even
when he finds her alone, uses no vulgar allurements.
&#8220;Ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>&#8221;
Milton, indeed, seasons his harangue with flattery:
but for this he has no warrant in Scripture.</p>

<p>As the Eve of Paradise should be majestically
sinless, so after the Fall she should not cower and
wail like a disappointed girl. Her infinite fault,
her infinite woe, her infinite penitence, should have
a touch of grandeur. She has paid the inevitable
price for that mighty knowledge of good and evil
she so coveted; that terrible predestined experience&mdash;she
has found it, or it has found her;&mdash;and
she wears her crown of grief as erst her crown of
innocence.</p>

<p class="tb">I think the noble picture of Eve in Mrs. Browning&#8217;s
Drama of Exile, as that of the Mother of our
redemption not less than the Mother of suffering
humanity, might be read and considered with advantage
by a modern sculptor.</p>

<p>The figure of Eve in Raphael&#8217;s design (the one
engraved by Marc Antonio) is exquisitely statuesque
as well as exquisitely beautiful. In the moment
that she presents the apple to Adam she looks&mdash;perhaps
she ought to look&mdash;like the <i>Venus Vincitrice</i>
of the antique time; but I am not sure; and,
at all events, the less of the classical sentiment the
better.</p>

<h4>ADAM.</h4>

<p>I have seen no statue of Adam; but surely he is
a fine subject, either alone or as the companion of
Eve; and the Miltonic type is here all-sufficient,
combining the heroic ideal of Greek art with something
higher still&mdash;</p>

<p>whence true authority in men&mdash;in fact, essential
manliness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<p>Goethe had the idea that Adam ought to be represented
with a spade, as the progenitor of all who
till the ground, and partially draped with a deerskin,
that is, after the Fall; which would be well:
but he adds that Adam should have a child at his
feet in the act of strangling a serpent. This appears
to me objectionable and ambiguous; if admissible at
all, the accessory figure would be a fitter accompaniment
for Eve.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><img src="images/illus-027.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="132" width="400" /></div>

<h4>ANGELS.</h4>

<p>Angels, properly speaking, are neither winged
men nor winged children. Wings, in ancient art,
were the symbols of a divine nature; and the early
Greeks, who humanised their gods and goddesses,
and deified humanity through the perfection of the
forms, at first distinguished the divine and the
human by giving wings to all the celestial beings;
thus lifting them above the earth. Our religious
idea of angels is altogether different. Give to the
child-form wings, in other words, give to the child-nature,
innocent, and pure, the adjuncts of wisdom
and power, and thus you realise the idea of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
angel as Raphael conceived it. It is so difficult to
imagine in the adult form the union of perfect purity
and perfect wisdom, the absence of experience and
suffering, and the capacity of thinking and feeling,
a condition of being in which all conscious <i>motive</i> is
lost in the <i>impulse</i> to good, that it remains a problem
in art. The angels of Angelico da Fiesole, who
are not only winged, but convey the idea of movement
only by the wings, not by the limbs, are exquisite,
as fitted to minister to us in heaven, but
hardly as fitted to keep watch and ward for us on
earth&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;Against foul fiends to aid us militant.&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>The feminine element always predominates in the
conception of angels, though they are supposed to
be masculine: I doubt whether it ought to be so.</p>

<p class="tb">While these sheets are going through the press, I
find the following beautiful passage relative to angels
in the last number of &#8220;Fraser&#8217;s Magazine&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is safer, even, and perhaps more orthodox and
scriptural, to &#8216;impersonate&#8217; time and space, strength
and love, and even the laws of nature, than to give
us any more angel worlds, which are but dead skeletons
of Dante&#8217;s creations without that awful and
living reality which they had in his mind; or to fill
children&#8217;s books, as the High Church party are doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
now, with pictures and tales of certain winged hermaphrodites,
in whom one cannot think (even by the
extremest stretch of charity) that the writers or
draughtsmen really believe, while one sees them servilely
copying medi&aelig;val forms, and intermingling
them with the ornaments of an extinct architecture;
thus confessing <i>na&iuml;vely</i> to every one but themselves,
that they accept the whole notion as an integral portion
of a creed, to which, if they be members of the
Church of England, they cannot well belong, seeing
that it was, happily for us, expelled both by law and
by conscience at the Reformation.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is eloquent and true; but not the less true
it is, that if we have to represent in art those &#8220;spiritual
beings who walk this earth unseen, both when
we sleep and when we wake&#8221;&mdash;beings, who (as the
author of the above passage seems to believe) may
be intimately connected with the phenomena of the
universe&mdash;we must have a type, a bodily type,
under which to represent them; and as we cannot do
this from knowledge, we must do it symbolically.
Angels, as we figure them, are <i>symbols</i> of moral and
spiritual existences elevated above ourselves&mdash;we do
not believe in the forms, we only accept their significance.
I should be glad to see a better impersonation
than the impossible creatures represented in art;
but till some artist-poet, or poet-artist, has invented
such an impersonation, we must employ that which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
is already familiarised to the eye and hallowed to
the fancy without imposing on the understanding.</p>

<h4>
MIRIAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RUTH.
</h4>

<p>Both the Old and the New Testament abound in
sculptural subjects; but fitly to deal with the Old
Testament required a Michal-Angelo. Beautiful as
are the gates of Ghiberti they are hardly what the
Germans would call &#8220;alt-testamentische,&#8221; they are so
essentially elegant and graceful, and the old Hebrew
legends and personages are so tremendous. Even
Miriam and Ruth dilate into a sort of grandeur. In
representation I always fancy them above life-size.</p>

<p class="tb">I doubt whether the same artist who could conceive
the Prophets would be able to represent the Apostles,
or that the same hand which gave us Moses could
give us Christ. Michal-Angelo&#8217;s idea of Christ,
both in painting and sculpture is, to me, revolting.</p>

CHRIST.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOLOMON.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DAVID.

<p>I do not like the idea of Moses and Christ placed
together. Much finer in artistic and moral contrast
would be the two teachers,&mdash;Christ as the divine and
spiritual law-giver, Solomon as the type of worldly
wisdom. They should stand side by side, or be seated
each on his throne, a crowned King, with book and
sceptre&mdash;but how different in character!</p>

<p class="tb">We have multiplied statues of David. I have
never seen one which realised the finest conception of
his character, either as Hero, King, Prophet, or Poet.
In general he figures as the slayer of Goliath, and is
always too feeble and boyish. David, singing to his
lute before Saul; David as the musician and poet,
young, beautiful, half-draped, heaven-inspired, exorcising
by his art the dark spirit of evil which possessed
the jealous King:&mdash;this would be a theme for an
artist, and would as finely represent the power of
sacred song as a figure of St. Cecilia. But the sentiment
should not be that of a young Apollo, or an
Orpheus; therein would lie the chief difficulty.</p>

<p>I remember to have seen fine statues of Hagar
holding her pitcher, of Rebekah contemplating her
bracelet, and of Rachel as the shepherdess. But I
would have a different version; Hagar as the poor
cast-away, driven forth with her boy into the wilderness;
Rebekah as the exulting bride; and Rachel
as the mild, pensive wife. They would represent, in
a very complete manner, contrasted phases of the
destiny of Woman, connected together by our religious
associations, and appealing to our deepest human
sympathies.</p>

<h4>THE QUEEN OF SHEBA.</h4>

<p>The Queen of Sheba would be a fine subject for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
single statue, as the religious type of the queenly,
intellectual woman, the treatment being kept as far
as possible from that of a Pallas or a Muse.</p>

<p class="tb">The journey of the Queen of the South to visit
Solomon would be a capital subject for a processional
bas-relief, and as a <i>pendant</i> to the journey of &#8220;the
Wise Men of the East,&#8221; to visit a greater than Solomon.
The latter has been perpetually treated from
the fourth century. Of the journey of the Queen
of Sheba I have seen, as yet, no example.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><img src="images/illus-011.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="203" width="300" /></div>

<h4>LADY GODIVA.</h4>

<p>With regard to statuesque subjects from modern
history and poetry,&mdash;<i>Romantic Sculpture</i>, as it is
styled,&mdash;the taste both of the public and the artist
evidently sets in this direction. That the treatment
of such subjects should not be classical is admitted;
but in the development of this romantic tendency
there is cause to fear that we may be inundated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
with all kinds of picturesque vagaries and violations
of the just laws and limits of art.</p>

<p class="tb">I remember, however, a circumstance which makes
me hopeful as to the progress of feeling; knowledge
may come hereafter. I remember about twenty
years ago proposing the figure and story of Lady
Godiva as beautiful subjects for sculpture and painting.
There were present on that occasion, among
others, two artists and a poet. The two artists
laughed outright, and the poet extemporised an
epigram upon Peeping Tom. If I were to propose
Lady Godiva as a subject now<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>, I believe it would
be received with a far different feeling even by those
very men. If I were Queen of England I would
have it painted in Fresco in my council chamber.
There should be seen the palfrey with its rich
housings, and near it, as preparing to mount, the
noble lady should stand, timid, but resolved: her
veil should lie on the ground; the drapery just falling
from her fair limbs and partly sustained by one hand,
while with the other she loosens her golden tresses.
A bevy of waiting-maids, with averted faces, disappear
hurriedly beneath the massive porch of the Saxon</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>
<p>palace, which forms the background, with sky and
trees seen through openings in the heavy architecture.
This is the picturesque version of the story; but
there are many others. As a single statue, the
figure of Lady Godiva affords an opportunity for
the legitimate treatment of the undraped female form,
sanctified by the purest, the most elevated associations;&mdash;by
woman&#8217;s tearful pride and man&#8217;s respect
and gratitude.</p>

<h4>JOAN OF ARC.</h4>

<p>Shakspeare, who is so horribly unjust to Joan
of Arc, has put a sublime speech into her mouth
where she answers Burgundy who had accused her
of sorcery,&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">

<span class="i0">You judge it straight a thing impossible</span>
<span class="i0">To compass wonders but by help of devils!&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>The whole theory of popular superstition comprised
in three lines!</p>

<p>But Joan herself&mdash;how at her name the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
heart seems to rise up in resentment, not so much
against her cowardly executioners as against those
who have so wronged her memory! Never was a
character, historically pure, bright, definite, and perfect
in every feature and outline, so abominably
treated in poetry and fiction,&mdash;perhaps for this
reason, that she was in herself so exquisitely wrought,
so complete a specimen of the heroic, the poetic, the
romantic, that she could not be touched by art or
modified by fancy, without being in some degree
profaned. As to art, I never saw yet any representation
of &#8220;Jeanne la grande Pastoure,&#8221; (except, perhaps,
the lovely statue by the Princess of Wurtemburg,)
which I could endure to look at&mdash;and even
that gives us the contemplative simplicity, but not
the power, intellect, and energy, which must have
formed so large a part of the character. Then as to
the poets, what shall be said of them? First Shakspeare,
writing for the English stage, took up the
popular idea of the character as it prevailed in England
in his own time. Into the hypothesis that the
greater part of Henry VI. is not by Shakspeare,
there is no occasion to enter here; the original
conception of the character of Joan of Arc may not
be his, but he has left it untouched in its principal
features. The English hated the memory of the
French Heroine because she had caused the loss of
France and had humiliated us as a nation; and our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
chroniclers revenged themselves and healed their
wounded self-love by imputing her victories to
witchcraft. Shakspeare, giving her the attributes
which the historians of his time assigned to her, represents
her as a warlike, arrogant sorceress&mdash;a
&#8220;monstrous woman&#8221;&mdash;attended and assisted by
demons. I pass over the depraved and perverse
spirit in which Voltaire profaned this divine character.
A theme which a patriot poet would have
approached as he would have approached an altar,
he has made a vehicle for the most licentious parody
that ever disgraced a national literature. Schiller
comes next, and hardly seems to me more excusable.
Not only has he missed the character, he has deliberately
falsified both character and fact. His
&#8220;Johanna&#8221; might have been called by any other
name; and the scene of his tragedy might have been
placed anywhere in the wide world with just the
same probability and truth. Schiller and Goethe held a
principle that all considerations were to yield before
the proprieties of art. But Milton speaks somewhere
of those &#8220;faultless proprieties of nature&#8221; which
never can be violated with impunity: and Art can
never move freely but in the domain of nature and
of truth. All the fine writing in Schiller&#8217;s &#8220;Maid
of Orleans&#8221; can never reconcile me to its absolute
and revolting falsehood. The sublime, simple-hearted
girl who to the last moment regarded herself as set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
apart by God to do His work, he makes the victim
of an insane passion for a young Englishman. In
the love-sick classical heroines of Corneille and Racine
there is nothing more Frenchified, more absurd,
more revolting. Then he makes her die victorious
on the field of battle defending the oriflamme;&mdash;far,
far more glorious as well as more pathetic her
real death&mdash;but it offended against Schiller&#8217;s &aelig;sthetic
conception of the dignity of tragedy.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have Southey&#8217;s epic: what shall be
said of it?&mdash;even what he said of the Lusiad of
Camoens, &#8220;that it is read with little emotion, and
remembered with little pleasure.&#8221; No. I do not
wish to see Joan turned into a heroine of tragedy or
tale, because, as it seems to me, the whole life and
death of this martyred girl is too near us, and too
historically distinct, and, I will add, too sacred, to
be dressed out in romantic prose or verse. What
Walter Scott might have made of her I do not
know&mdash;something marvellously picturesque and life-like,
no doubt&mdash;and yet I am glad he did not try
his hand on her. But she remains a legitimate and
most admirable subject for representative art; and
as yet nothing has been done in sculpture to fix the
ideal and heroic in her character, nor in painting,
worthy of her exploits. There exists no contemporary
portrait of her except in the brief description of her
in the old French Chronicle of the Siege of Orleans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
where it is said that her figure was tall and slender,
her bust fine, her hair and eyes black; that she wore
her hair short, and could never be persuaded to put
on a head-piece, and farther (and in this respect both
Schiller and Southey have wronged her), that she
had never slain a man, using her consecrated sword
merely to defend herself. I should like to see a fine
equestrian statue of her by one of our best English
sculptors, set up in a conspicuous place among us, as
a national expiation.</p>

<p>Southey mentions that in the beginning of the
last war, about 1795, when popular feeling, excited
almost to frenzy, raged against France, a pantomime,
or ballet, was performed at Covent Garden, from the
story of Joan of Arc, at the conclusion of which she
is carried away by demons, like a female Don Juan.
This denouement caused such a storm of indignation,
that the author&mdash;one James Cross&mdash;was obliged,
after the first two or three representations, to change
the demons into angels, and send her straight into
Heaven:&mdash;an anecdote pleasant to record as illustrating
the sure ultimate triumph of truth over falsehood;
of all the better sympathies over prejudice
and wrong;&mdash;in spite of history, and, what is more,
in spite of Shakspeare!</p>

<h4>CHARACTERS FROM SHAKSPEARE.</h4>

<p>Joan of Arc is not, however, a Shakspearian
character; and, in fact, there are very few of his personages
susceptible of sculptural treatment. They
are too dramatic, too profound, too complex in their
essential nature where they are tragic; too many-sided
and picturesque where they are comic.</p>

<p>For instance, the attempt to condense into marble
such light, evanescent, quaint creations as those in
&#8220;The Midsummer&#8217;s Night&#8217;s Dream&#8221; is better avoided;
we feel that a marble fairy must be a heavy absurdity.
Oberon and Titania might perhaps float along
in a bas-relief; but we cannot put away the thought
that they have reality without substantiality, and we
do not like to see them, or Ariel, or Caliban fixed
in the definite forms of sculpture.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few of Shakspeare&#8217;s characters
which appear to me beautifully adapted for
statuesque treatment: Perdita holding her flowers;
Miranda lingering on the shore; might well replace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
the innumerable &#8220;Floras&#8221; and &#8220;Nymphs preparing
to bathe,&#8221; which people the <i>at&eacute;liers</i> of our sculptors.
Cordelia has something of marble quietude about
her; and Hermione is a statue ready made. And,
by the way, it is observable that Shakspeare represents
Hermione as a <i>coloured</i> statue. Paulina will
not allow it to be touched, because &#8220;the colour is
not yet dry.&#8221; Again,&mdash;</p>

<p>I think it possible to model small ornamental
statuettes and groups from some few of the scenes in
Shakspeare&#8217;s plays; but this is quite different from
life-size figures of Hamlet, Othello, Shylock, Macbeth,
which must either have the look of real individual
portraiture, or become mere idealisations of
certain qualities; and Shakspeare&#8217;s creations are
neither the one nor the other.</p>

<h4>CHARACTERS FROM SPENSER.</h4>

<p>Spenser is so essentially a picturesque poet, he
depends for his rich effects so much on the combination
of colour and imagery, and multiplied accessories,
that one feels&mdash;at least <i>I</i> feel, on laying down a
volume of the &#8220;Fairie Queene&#8221; dazzled as if I had
been walking in a gallery of pictures. His &#8220;Masque
of Cupid,&#8221; for instance, although a procession of
poetical creations, could not be transferred to a bas-relief
without completely losing its Spenserian character&mdash;its
wondrous glow of colour. Thus Cupid
&#8220;uprears himself exulting from the back of the
ravenous lion;&#8221; removes the bandage from his eyes,
that he may look round on his victims; &#8220;shakes
the darts which his right hand doth strain full
dreadfully,&#8221; and &#8220;claps on high his coloured wings
twain.&#8221; This certainly is not the Greek Cupid, nor
the Cupid of sculpture; it is the Spenserian Cupid.
So of his Una, so of his Britomart, and the Red Cross
Knight and Sir Guyon: one might make elegant
<i>statuesque</i> impersonations of the allegories they involve,
as of Truth, Chastity, Faith, Temperance; but
then they would lose immediately their Spenserian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
character and sentiment, and must become something
altogether different.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><img src="images/illus-014.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="179" width="300" /></div>

<h4>
THE LADY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMUS.
</h4>

<p>It is not so with Milton. The &#8220;Lady&#8221; in
Comus, whether she stands listening to the echos of
her own sweet voice, or motionless as marble under
the spell of the &#8220;false enchanter,&#8221; <i>looking</i> that divine
reproof which in the poem she <i>speaks</i>,&mdash;</p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">&#8220;I hate when vice can bolt her arguments,</span>
<span class="i0">And virtue has no tongue to check her pride&#8221;&mdash;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>is a subject perfectly fitted for sculpture, and never,
so far as I know, executed. It would be a far more
appropriate ornament for a lady&#8217;s <i>boudoir</i> than
French statues of <span class="smcap">Modesty</span>, which generally have
the effect of making one feel very much ashamed.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Sabrina has been beautifully treated by Marshall.</p>

<p>It is difficult to render Comus without making
him too like a Bacchus or an Apollo. He is neither.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>
<p>He represents not the beneficent, but the intoxicating
and brutifying power of wine. His joviality should
not be that of a God, but with something mischievous,
bestial, Faun-like; and he should have,
with the Dionysian grace, a dash of the cunning and
malignity of his Mother Circe. These characteristics
should be in the mind of the artist. The panther&#8217;s
skin, the coronal of vine leaves, and, instead of the
Thyrsus, the magician&#8217;s wand, are the proper accessories.
It is also worth notice, that in the antique
representations Comus has wings as a demigod, and
in a picture described by Philostratus (a night scene)
he lies crouched in a drunken sleep. Little use, however,
is made of him in the antique myths, and the
Miltonic conception is that which should be embodied
by the modern sculptor.</p>

<p class="tb">Il Penseroso and L&#8217;Allegro, if embodied in
sculpture as poetical abstractions (either masculine
or feminine) of Melancholy and Mirth, would cease
to be Miltonic, for the conceptions of the poet are
essentially picturesque, and expressed in both cases
by a luxuriant accumulation of images and accessories,
not to be brought within the limits of plastic
art without the most tasteless confusion and inconsistency.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;"><img src="images/illus-054.png" alt="Decoration." title="" height="126" width="200" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span></p>

<h4>SATAN.</h4>

<p>The religious idea of a Satan&mdash;the impersonation
of that mixture of the bestial, the malignant,
the impious, and the hopeless, which constitute
<span class="smcap">the Fiend</span>, the enemy of all that is human
and divine&mdash;I conceive to be quite unfitted for
the purpose of sculpture. Danton&#8217;s attempt degenerates
into grim caricature. Milton&#8217;s Satan&mdash;&#8220;the
archangel ruined,&#8221;&mdash;is however a strictly
poetical creation, and capable of the most poetical
statuesque treatment. But we must remember that,
if it be a gross mistake, religious and artistic, to
conceive the Messiah under the form of a larger,
stronger humanity, with a <i>physique</i> like that of a
wrestler, (as M. Angelo has done in the Last Judgement)
it is equally a mistake to conceive the lost
angel, our spiritual adversary, under any such coarse
Herculean lineaments. There can be no image of
the Miltonic Satan without the elements of beauty,
&#8220;though changed by pale ire, envy, and despair!&#8221;
Colossal he may be, vast as Mount Athos; but it is
not necessary to express this that he should be hewn
out of Mount Athos, or look like the giant Polypheme!
His proportions, his figure, his features&mdash;like
his power&mdash;are angelic. As the Hero&mdash;for he
is so&mdash;of the &#8220;Paradise Lost,&#8221; the subject is open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
to poetic treatment; but I am not aware that as yet
it has been poetically treated.</p>

<p>Of the Italian poetry and history, and all the
wondrous and lovely shapes which come thronging
out of that Elysian land,&mdash;I can say nothing now,&mdash;or
only this,&mdash;that after all I am not <i>quite</i> sure that
I am right about Spenser. For, at first view, what
poet seems less amenable to statuesque treatment
than Dante? One would have imagined that only a
preternatural fusion of Michal-Angelo and Rembrandt
could fitly render the murky recesses and
ghastly and monstrous inhabitants of the Inferno, or
attempt to shadow forth the dazzling mysteries of
the Paradiso. Yet see what Flaxman has achieved!
His designs are legitimate bas-reliefs, not pictures in
outline. He has been true to his own art, and all
that could be done within the limitations of his art he
has accomplished. It is a translation of Dante&#8217;s
<i>ideas</i> into sculpture, with every thing <i>peculiarly</i>
Dantesque in the treatment, set aside.</p>

<p>Now as to our more modern poets.&mdash;From amid
the long array of beautiful subjects which seem to
move in succession before the fancy, there are two
which stand out prominent in their beauty. First,
Lord Byron&#8217;s &#8220;Myrrha,&#8221; who with her Ionian elegance
is susceptible of the purest classical treatment.
She should hold a torch; but not with the air of a
M&aelig;nad, nor of a Thais about to fire Persepolis.
The sentiment should be deeper and quieter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span></p>

<table summary="poem"><tr><td><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">A Greek girl dare not do for love that which</span>
<span class="i0">An Indian widow does for custom?&#8221;</span>
</div></div></td></tr></table>

<p>Ion in Talfourd&#8217;s Tragedy&mdash;the boy-hero, in all
the tenderness of extreme youth, already self-devoted
and touched with a melancholy grace and an elevation
beyond his years&mdash;is so essentially statuesque,
that I am surprised that no sculptor has attempted
it; perhaps because, in this instance, as in that of
Myrrha, the popular realisation of both characters as
subjects of formative art has been spoiled by theatrical
trappings and associations.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
